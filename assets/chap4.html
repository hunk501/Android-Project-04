		<h3>TRIUMPHS IN ATENEO, 1872-77</h3>
		<h5><i>
			"Hold high the brow serene, O youth, where now you stand; Let the bright sheen Of your grace be seen, Fair hope of my fatherland!" -Jose Rizal
		</i></h5>
		<br>
		<div>
			Four months after . the martyrdom of Gom-Bur-Za and with Dona Teodora still in prison, Jose , who had not yet celebrated his eleventh birthday, was sent to Manila. He studied in the Ateneo Municipal , a college under the super vision of the Spanish Jesuits. This college was a bitter rival of the Dominican-owned College of San Juan De Letran. It was formerly the Escuela Pia (Charity School) a school for poor boys in Manila which was established by the city government in 1817. When the Jesuits who had been expelled from the Philippines in 1768 returned to Manila in 1859, they were given the management of the  Escuela Pia, whose name was changed to Ateneo Municipal and later became the Ateneo De Manila. They had lost all their properties during the period of their exile hence they were given splendid educators, so that within a few years Ateneo acquired wide prestige as an excellent college for boys.

		<div>
			Rizal Enters the Ateneo. On June 10, 1872, Jose, accompanied by Paciano, went to Manila. He took the entrance examinations on Christian doctrine, arithmetic, and reading at the College of San Juan de Letran and passed them all. He returned to Calamba to stay a few days with his family and to attend the town fiesta. His father who first wished him to study at Letran change his mind and decided to send him to the Ateneo instead.
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			Thus, upon his return to Manila Jose again accompanied by Paciano, matriculated at the Ateneo Municipal. At first, Father Magin Ferrando, who was the college registrar, refused to admit him for two reason: (1) he was late for registration and (2) he was sickly and undersized for his age. Rizal was then eleven years old. However. Upon the intercession of Manuel Xerez Burgos, nephew of Father Burgos, he was reluctantly admitted at the Ateneo.
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			Jose was the first of his family to adopt the surname "Rizal" He registered under this name at the Ateneo because their first family name "Mercado"  had come under suspicion of the Spanish authorities. Paciano had used "Mercado" as his surname at the College of San Jose and he was known to the authorities as Father Burgos favorite student and helper.
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			At the time Jose studied in the Ateneo, this college was located in Intramuros, within the walls of Manila. He first boarded in a house outside Intramuros, on Caraballo Street, 25 minutes walk from college This boarding house was owned by a spinster named Titay who owed the Rizal family the amount of P300. Jose boarded with her in order to collect part of the debt. Jesuit System of Education. The system of education given by the Jesuits in the Ateneo was advanced from that of other colleges in that period. It trained the character of the student by rigid discipline and religious instruction. It promoted physical culture, fine arts and scientific studies. Aside from academic courses leading to the degree of A.B. it offered vocational courses in agriculture, commerce and mechanics.
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			The students heard Mass in the morning before the beginning of the daily class. Class in every subject was opened and closed with prayers.
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			Students were divided into two groups, namely: the Roman Empire consisting of the internos (boarders) and the Carthaginian Empire composed of the externos (non-boarders.) Each of these empires had its ranks. The best student in each empire ws the emperor, the second best the tribune; the third best, the Decurion the fourth best the centurion: and the fifth best, the standard-bearer, Within the empire, the students fought for positions. Any student could challenge any officer in his empire to answer questions on the days lesson. His opponent could lose his position of he committed three mistakes. Any student might be at the end of the line. If he studied hard and was brilliant he could depose the officers one after another and be an emperor.
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			The two groups, "Roman Empire" and "Carthaginian Empire" were in perpetual warfare for supremacy in the mans and blue for the Carthaginians. At the beginning of the school term, both banners were used equally in the  classroom . Upon the first defeat, the banner of the losing party was transferred to the left side of the room. Upon the second, it was placed in an inferior position on the right side. Upon the third the inclined flag was placed on the left. Upon the fourth the flag was reversed and returned to the right.Upon the fifth the reversed flag was place on the left. Upon the sixth the banner was changed with the figure of a donkey.
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			The Ateneo students in Rizal time wore a uniform which consisted of "hemp-fabric trousers" and striped cotton coat. The coat material was call rayadillo which later became famous for it was adopted as uniform for the Filipino troops during the days of the First Philippine Republic.
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			Rizals First Year in Ateneo (1872-73). On his first day of class in the Ateneo in June 1872 Rizal first heard Mass at the college chapel and prayed fervently to God for guidance and success. When the Mass was finished he went to his class where he saw " a great number of boys, Spaniards mestizos and Filipinos"
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			Rizals first professor in the Ateneo was Fr. Jose bech. Whom he described as "tall , thin man with a body slightly bent forward a hurried walk an ascetic face severe and inspired small deep-sunken eyes a sharp nose that was almost Greek and thin lips forming an arc whose ends fell toward the chin.
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			Being a newcomer and knowing little Spanish Rizal was placed at the bottom of the class. He was an externo hence he was assigned to the Carthaginians occupying the end of the line.
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			After the first week, the frail Calamba boy progressed rapidly At the end of the month, he became "emperor" He was the brightest in the whole class and he was awarded a prize. "How pleased I was" he said "when I won my first prize, a religious picture!" That prize was a religious picture. He was proud of it because it was the first prize he ever won in the Ateneo.
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			To improve his Spanish , Rizal took private lessons in Santa Isabel College during the noon recesses, when other Ateneo students were playing or gossiping. He paid three pesos for those extra Spanish lessons but it was money well spent.
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			In the second half of his year in the Ateneo , Rizal did not try hard enough to retain his scholarship supremacy which he held during the first half of the term. This was because he resented more remarks of his professor. He placed second at the end of the year, although all his grades were still marked "excellent"
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			<b>Summer vacation (1873)</b>. At the end of the school year March 1873 Rizal returned to Calamba for summer vacation. He did not particularly enjoy his vacation because his mother was in prison. To cheer him up, his sister Neneng (Saturnina) Brought him to Tanawan with her. This did not cure his melancholy. Without telling his father , he went to Santa Cruz and visited his mother in prison. He told her of his brilliant grades in the Ateneo and tearfully embraced each other.
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			The summer vacation ended, Rizal returned to manila for his second year term in the Ateneo. This time he boarded inside Intramuros at No.6 Magallanes Street. His landlady was an old widow named Dona Pepay who had a widowed daughter and four sons.
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			<b>Second Year in Ateneo (1873-74)</b>. Nothing unusual happened to Rizal during his second term in the Ateneo, except that he repented having neglected his studies the previous year simply because he was offended by the teacher remarks and so to regain his lost class leadership, he studied harder, Once more he became "emperor"
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			Some of his classmates were new. Among them were three boys from Binan. Who had been his classmates in the school of maestro Justiniano.
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			At the end of the school year Rizal received excellent grades in all subjects and a gold medal. With such scholastic honors he triumphantly returned to Calamba in March 1874 for summer vacation.
		</div>
		<img src="img4.jpg" style="width:100%; height:auto;">
		<div>
			<b>Prophecy of Mother's Release</b>. Rizal lost no time in going to Santa Cruz in order to visit his mother in the provincial jail. He gladdened Dona Teodoras lonely heart with his scholastic triumphs in Ateneo and with funny tales about his professors and fellow students. The mother was very happy to se her favorite child making such splendid progress in college.
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			In the course of their conversation. Dona Teodora told her son of her dream the previous night. Rizal interpreting such dream said to her that she would be released from prison in three months time. Dona Teodora smiled, thinking that her son's prophecy was a mere boyish attempt to console her.
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			But Rizal's prophecy became true. Barely three months passed. And suddenly Dona Teodora was set free. By that time Rizal was already in Manila attending his classes in the Ateneo.
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			Dona Teodora happily back in Calamba was more proud of her son Jose who was like the youthful Joseph in the Bible. The Biblical Joseph was the youngest and most beloved son of Jacob. His elder brothers were jealous of him because their father showered him with affection. One day these bad elder brothers sold him into slavery in Egypt. Joseph's master was a prominent Egyptian official. His voluptuous wife fell in love with Joseph, but the latter did not reciprocate her affection. Angered by the slave's refusal to respond to her desire, she dastardly fabricated a charge against Joseph. Thus Joseph was put in prison. However, he was able to win his freedom and high royal honors by interpreting correctly the Pharoah's dream of seven years of plenty and seven years of famine.
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			Teenage Interest in Reading. It was during the summer vacation in 1874 in Calamba when Rizal began to take interest in reading romantic novels. As a normal teenager he became interested in love stories and romantic tales.
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			The first favorite novel of rizal was the Count of Monte Cristo by Alexander Dumas, This thrilling novel made a deep impression on him. His boyish imagination was stirred by the sufferings of Edmond Dantes (the hero) in prison. His spectacular escape from the dungeon of Chateau d'If, his finding of the buried treasure on the rocky island of Monte Cristo, and his dramatic revenge on his enemies who wronged him.
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			Rizal read numerous other romantic novels with deep interest. The reading habit helped to enrich his fecund mind.
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			As a voracious reader, he read not only fiction, but also non- fiction. He persuaded his father to buy him a costly set of Cesar Cantu's historical work entitled Universal History. According t o Rizal, this valuable work was of great aid in his studies and enable him to win more prizes in Ateneo.
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			Later Rizal read Travels in the Philippines by Dr. Feodor Jagor, German scientist – traveler who had visited the Philippines. What impressed him in this book were (1) Jagor's keen observations of the defects of Spanish colonization and (2) his prophecy that someday Spain would lose the Philippines and that America would come to succeed her as colonizer.
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			<b>Third Year in Ateneo (1874 -75)</b>. In June, 1874, Rizal returned to the Ateneo for his junior year. Shortly after the opening of classes, his mother arrived and joyously told him that she was released from prison, just as he predicted during his last visit to her prison cell in Santa Cruz, Laguna. He was happy, of course, to see his mother once more a free woman.
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			However, despite the family happiness, Rizal did not make an excellent showing in his studies as in the previous year. His grades remained excellent in all subjects, but he won only one medal – in Latin. He failed to win the medal in Spanish because his spoken Spanish was not fluently sonorous. He was beaten by a Spaniard who naturally could speak Spanish with fluency and with right accentuation.
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			At the end of the school year (March, 1875), Rizal returned to Calamba for summer vacation. He himself was not impressed by his scholastic work. He said: "I returned dissatisfied to my home town."
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			<b>Fourth Year in Ateneo (1875 – 76)</b>. After a refreshing and happy summer vacation, Rizal went back to Manila for his fourth year course. On June 14, 1875, he became an internee in the Ateneo. One of his professors this time was Fr. Francisco Sanchez, a great educator and scholar. He inspired young Rizal to study harder and write poetry. He became an admire and friend of the slender Calamba lad, whose God – given genius he saw and recognized since their first meeting. On his part, Rizal had the highest affection and respect for Father Sanchez, whom he considered his most beloved professor in the Ateneo.
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			Years later Rizal wrote of Father Sanchez in glowing terms, showing his affection and gratitude. He described this Jesuit professor as "a model of rectitude, solicitude, and devotion to his pupils' progress".
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			Inspired by Father Sanchez, Rizal resumed his studies with vigor and zest. He topped all his classmates in all subjects and won five medals at the end of the school term. He returned to Calamba for his summer vacation (March 1876) and proudly offered his five medals and excellent ratings to his parents. He was extremely happy, for he was able to repay his "father somewhat for his sacrifies."
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			Last Year in Ateneo (1876 – 77). After the summer vacation, Rizal returned to Manila in June, 1876 for his last year in Ateneo. His studies continued to fare well. As a matter – of – fact, he excelled in all subjects. The most brilliant Atenean of his time, he was truly "the pride of the Jesuits". Rizal finished his last year in the Ateneo in a blaze of glory. He obtained the highest grades  in all subjects – philosophy, physics, biology, chemistry, languages, mineralogy, etc.
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			Graduation with Highest Honors. Rizal graduated at the head of his class. His scholastic records at the Ateneo from 1872 to 1877 are as follows:

		<br>
		<div>
			On Commencement Day, March 23, 1877, Rizal, who was 16 years old, received from his Alma Mater, Ateneo Municipal, and the degree of Bachelor of Arts, with highest honors. It was proud day for his family. But to Rizal, like all graduates, Commencement day was a time of bitter sweetness, a joy mellowed with poignancy. The night before graduation, his last night at the college dormitory, he could not sleep. Early the following morning, the day of graduation, he prayed fervently at the college chapel and "commended my life," as he said, "to the Virgin so that she might protect me when I set foot in that world which inspired me with such dread."
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			Extra – Curricular Activities at Ateneo. Rizal, unsurpassed in academic triumphs, was not a mere bookworm. He was active in extra – curricular activities. An "emperor" inside the classroom, he was a campus leader outside. He was an active member, later secretary, of a religious society, the Marian Congregation. He was accepted as member of his sodality not only because of his academic brilliance but also because of his devotion to Our lady, Only Ateneans who distinguished themselves in class for their piety and good scholarship could be members of this society. Rizal was also a member of the Academy of Spanish Literature and the Academy of Natural Sciences. The "academies" were exclusive societies in the Ateneo, to which only Ateneans who were gifted in literature and sciences could qualify for membership.
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			In his leisure hours, Rizal cultivated his literary talents under the guidance of Father Sanchez. Another professor Father Jose Vilaclara, advised him to stop communing with the Muses and pay more attention to more practical studies, such as philosophy and natural sciences. Rizal did not heed his advice. He continued to solicit Father Sanchez' help in improving his poetry.
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			Aside from writing poetry, he devoted his spare time in fine arts. He studied painting under the famous Spanish painter, Agustin Saez, and sculpture under Romualdo de Jesus, noted Filipino sculptor. Both art masters honored him with their affection, for he was a talented pupil.
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			Furthermore, Rizal, to develop his week body, engaged in gymnastic and fencing. He thereby continued the physical training he began under his sports - minded Uncle Manuel.
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			<b>Sculpture Works in Ateneo</b>. Rizal impressed his Jesuit professors in the Ateneo with his arctic skill. One day he carved an image of our Virgin Mary on a piece of batikuling (Philippine hardwood) with his pocket – knife.  The Jesuit Fathers were amazed at the beauty and grace of the image.
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			Father Lleonart, impressed by Rizal's sculptural talent, requested him to carve for him an image of the Scared Heart of Jesus. Young Rizal complied, and within a few days he presented it to Father Lleonart. The old Jesuit was highly pleased and profusely thanked the teenage sculptor. He intended to take the image with him to Spain, but being an absent – minded professor, he forgot to do so. The Ateneo boarding students placed it on the door if their dormitory, and there it remained for nearly 20 years, reminding all Ateneans of Dr, Rizal, the greatest alumnus of their Alma Mater. This image played a significant part in Rizal's last hour at Fort Santiago.
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			Anecdote on Ruzal the Atenean. One of Rizal's contemporaries in the Ateneo was Felix M. Roxas. He related an incident of Rizal's school days in the Ateneo which reveals the hero's resignation to pain and forgiveness. One day may Ateneans, including Rizal, were studying their lessons at the study – hall. Two Ateneans, manzano and Lesaca, quarreled and violently hurled books at each other. Rizal, who was busy at his desk poring over his lessons, was hit in the face by one of the thrown books. He did not raise a cry of protest, although his wounded face was bleeding. His classmates brought him to the infirmary where he had to undergo medical treatment for several days. After the incident, he continued to attend his classes, feeling neither bitterness nor rancor toward the guilty party.
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			Another anecdote on Rizal the Atenean was related by Manuel Xares Burgos, in whose house Rizal boarded shortly before he became an internee in the Ateneo. This anecdote illustrates Rizal's predilection to help the helpless at the risk of his own life. One Thursday afternoon, being vacation day, the boys flew their kites from the azotea. Young Rizal them was busy readinga Spanish book of fables at the window, after a while he heard Julio Melliza from Iloilo, one of the smallest boarders, crying – because his kite was caught by the vines growing on the belfry of the Manila Cathedral which was near the boarding – house. The bigger boys were laughing, making fun of Julio's misfortune. Rizal closed the book he was reading and told Julio not to cry, for he would try to retrieve the kite. True to his promise he courageously climbed the high cathedral tower and successfully recovered the kite.  
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			Poems Written in Ateneo. It was Doña Teodora who first discovered the poetical genius of her son, and it was also she who first encouraged him to write poems. However, it was father Sanchez who inspired Rizal to make full use of his God – given genius in poetry and improved the latter's poetical arts by opening his mind to the enriching influences of world's literature.
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			The first poem Rizal probably wrote during his days in the Ateneo was Mi Primera Inspiracion (My First Inspiration) which was dedicated to his mother on her birthday. It is said that he wrote it before he was 14 years old that is in the years 1874. Before this year he did not write poetry because there was gloom in his heart owing to his mother's imprisonment. Upon the release of his mother in 1874, his poetic heart began to sing with ecstasy and joy.
		</div>
		<br>
		<div class="poem">
			In 1875, inspired by father Sanchez, he wrote more poems, such as:
			<p>1. Felicitacion  (Felicitation)</p>
			<p>2. El Embarque : Himno a la Flota de Magallanes ( The Departure : Hymn to Magellan's Fleet)</p>
			<p>3. Y Es Español : Elcano, el Primero en dar la Vuelta el Mundo ( and He is Spanish: Elcano, the First to Circumnavigate the World)</p>
			<p>4. El Combate: Urbiztondo, Terror de Jolo (The Battle: Urbiztondo Terror of Jolo).</p>
		</div>
		<br>
		<div class="poem">
			<p>In 1876, Rizal wrote poems on various topics – religion, education, childhood memories, and war. They were as follows:</p>
			<p>1. La Tragedia de San Eustaquio (The Tragedy of St. Eustace.) This poem recounts the tragic story of St. Eustace.</p>
			<p>2. Un Recuerdo a Mi Pueblo (In Memory of My Town).A tender poem in honor of Calamba, the hero's natal town.</p>
			<p>3. Alianza Intima Entre la Religion y la Buena Educacion (Intimate Alliance between Religion and Good Education)</p>
			<p>4. Por la Educacion Recibe Lustre la Patria (Through Education the Country Receives Light.)</p>
			<p>5. El Cautiverio y el Triunjo: Batalla de Lucena y Prision de Boadbli (The Captivity and the Triumph: Battle of Lucena and the Imprisonment of Boadbil). This martial poem describes the defeat and capture of Boadbil, last Moorish sultan of Granada.</p>
			<p>6. La Entrada Truinjal de los Reyes Catolicos en Granada (The Triumphal Entry of the Catholic Monarchs into Granada). This poem relates the victorious entry of King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella into Granada, last Moorish stronghold in Spain.</p>
			<p>A year later, in 1877, he wrote more poems. It was his last year in the Ateneo. Among the poems written this year were:</p>
			<p>1. El Heroismo de Colon (The Heroism of Columbus). This poem praises Columbus, the discover of America.</p>
			<p>2. Colon y Juan II (Columbus and John II). This poem relates how King John II of Portugal missed famed and riches by his failure to finance the projected expedition of Columbus to the New World.</p>
			<p>3. Gran Consuelo en la Mayor Desdicha (Great Comfort in Great Misfortune). This is a legend in verse of the voyage of Columbus.</p>
			<p>4. Un Dialogo Alusivo a la Despedida de los Colegiales (A Farewell Dialogue of the Students). This was the last poem written by Rizal in Ateneo; it is a poignant poem of farewell to his classmates.</p>
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			"My First Inspiration". It was most fitting that the first poem written by Rizal as an Atenean should be about his beloved mother. In his poem, Mi Primera Inspiracion, he felicitated his mother on her Birthday, expressing his filial affection in sonorous verses. It turns as follows:
		</div>
		<br>
		<div class="poem">
			<p>MY FIRST INSPIRATION</p>
			<p>Why do the scented bowers 
				In Fragrant fray
				Rival festive day
				Why is sweet melody bruited?
				In the sylvan dale
				Harmony sweet and fluted 
				Like the nightingale?
				Why do the birds sing so? 
				In the tender grass,
				Flitting from bough to bough 
				With the winds that pass?
				And why does the crystal spring
				Run among the flowers
				While lullaby zephyrs sing
				Like it crystal showers?
				I see the dawn in the East
				With beauty endowed,
				Why goes she to a feast
				In a carmine cloud
				Sweet mother, they celebrate
				Your natal day
				The rose with her scent innate
				The Bird with his lay
				The murmurous spring this day
				Without alloy.
				Murmuring bid you always
				To live in joy.
				While the crystalline murmurs glisten,
				Hear you the accents strong
				Struck from my lyre, listen!
				To my love's first song,
			</p>
		</div>

			Rizal's Poems on Education.  Although Rizal was merely a teenager, he had a very high regard for education. He believed in the significant role which education plays in the progress and welfare of a nation. Thus he stated in his poem:
		</div>
		<br>
		<div class="poem">
			The Vital breath of prudent Education
			Instills a virtue of enchanting power:
			She lifts the motherland to highest station
			And endless dazzling glories on her shower
			And as the zephyr's gentle exhalation
			Revives the matrix of the fragrant flower,
			So education multiplies her gifts of grace;
			<p>
				For her a mortal man will gladly part
				With all he has; will give his calm repose;
				For her are born all science and all arts,
				Those brows of men with laurel fair enclose.
				As from the towering mountains lofty heart
				The purest current of the streamlet flows,
				So education without stint or measure gives 
				Security and peace to lands in which he lives.
			</p>
			<p>
				Where education reigns on lofty seat
				Youth blossoms forth with vigor and agility
				His error subjugates with solid feet,
				And his exalted by conceptions of nobility
				She breaks the neck of vice and its deceit;
				Black crime turns pale at her hostility
				The barbarous nation she knows how to tame
				From savages creates heroic fame.
			</p>
			<P>
				And as the spring doth sustenance bestow
				On all the plant, on bushes in the mead
				Its placid plenty goes to overflow
				And endlessly with lavish love to feed
				The banks by which it wanders, gliding slow
				Supplying beauteous nature's every need
				So he who prudent Education doth procure
				The towering heights of honor will secure
			</P>
			<p>From out his lips the water crystal pure
				Of perfect virtue shall not cease to go
				With careful doctrines of his faith made sure
				The powers of evil he will overthrow
			</p>	
			<p>Like foaming waves that never long endure nd from his good example other men shall learn Their upward steps toward the heavenly paths to turn</p>
			<p>Within the breast of wretched humankind
				She lights the living flame of goodness bright
				The hands of fiercest criminal doth bind
				And in those breast will surely pour delight
				Which seek her mystic benefits to find?
				Those souls she sets aflame with love of right
				That gives to life its surest consolation.
			</p>
			<p>
				And as the mighty rock aloft may tower
				Above the center of the stormy deep
				In scorn of storm, on fierce sou'wester's power
				Or fury of the waves that raging sweep
				Until their first made hatred spent, they cower
				And tired at last subside and fall asleep
				So he that takes wise Education by the hand 
				Invincible shall guide the reigns of motherland
			</p>
			<p>
				On sapphires shall his be engraved?
				A thousand honors to him by his land be granted
				For in their bosoms will his noble sons have saved?
				Luxuriant flowers his virtue had transplanted
				And by the love of goodness ever laved
				The lord and governors will see implanted
				To endless days the Christian Education
				Within their noble faith – enraptured nation
			</p>
			<p>
				And as in early morning we behold
				The ruby sun pours forth resplendent rays
				And lovely dawn her scarlet and her gold
				Her brilliant colors all about her sprays
				So skillful noble teaching doth unfold
				To living mind the joy of virtuous ways
				She offers our dear motherland the light
				That leads us too immoral glory's height
			</p>
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			In another poem, The Intimate Alliance Between Religion and Good Education, Rizal showed the importance of religion in education. To him, education without God is not true education. Thus he said in his poem.

			<p>THE INTIMATE ALLIANCE BETWEEN RELIGIONS</p>
			<p>
				As the climbing ivy over lofty elm
				Creeps tortuously, together the adornment
				Of the verdant plain embellishing 
				Each other and together growing
				But should the kindly elm refuse its aid
				The ivy would important and friendless wither
				So is Education to Religion
				By spiritual alliance bound
				Through Religion Education gains renown and 
				Woe to the impious mind that blindly spurning 
				The sapient teachings of Religion this 
				Unpolluted fountain – head forsakes
			</p>
			<p>
				As the sprout growing from the pompous vine
				Proudly offers us its honeyed clusters
				While the generous and loving sarment
				Feeds its roots so the freshening waters
				Of celestial virtue give new life
				To education true, shedding
				On it warmth and light: because of them
				The vine smells sweet and gives delicious fruit
			</p>
			<p>
				Without religion Human education
				Is like unto a vessel struck by winds
				Which sore beset is of its helm deprived
				By the roaring blows and buffets wields
				His power until he proudly sends her down
				Into the deep abysses of the angered sea
			</p>
			<p>
				As heavens dew the meadow feeds and strengthens
				So that blooming flowers all the earth
				Embroider in the days of spring so also 
				If religion holy nourishes
				Education with its doctrines,
				Shall walk in joy and generosity
				Toward be good, and everywhere bestrew
				The fragrant and luxuriant fruits of Virtue,

			Rizal's Religious Poems. During his student days Rizal expressed his devotion to his Catholic Faith in melodious poetry. One of the religious poems he wrote was a brief ode entitled Al Nino Jesus(to the Child Jesus). It is as Follows:
		</div>
		<br>
		<div class="poem">
			<p>TO THE CHILD JESUS</p>
			<p>
				How, God- Child hast Thou come 
			To earth in cave Forlorn?
			Does Fortune now deride Thee
			When Thou art scarcely born?
			Ah, woe! Celestial King,
			Who mortal from Dost Keep,
			Wouldn't rather than be Sovereign,
			Be Shepherd of thy Sheep?
			</p>
		</div>

			This poem was written in 1875 when he was 14 years old. Another religious poem which he wrote was entitled A la Virgin Maria (To the Virgin Mary). This poem is undated, so that we do not know exactly when it was written. Probably, Rizal wrote it after his ode to the Child Jesus. It runs as Follows:
		</div>
		<br>
		<div clas="poem">
			<p>TO THE VIRGIN MARY</p>
			<p>
				Dear Mary, giving comport and sweet peace
				To all afflicted mortals; thou the spring
				Whence flows a current of relief, to bring
				Our soil fertility that does not cease;
				Upon thy throne, where thou dost reign on high
				Oh, list with rises swiftly to the sky.
				And spread thy radiant mantle to receive
				My voice which rises swiftly to the sky,
				Placed Mary, thou my mother dear,
				My sustenance, my fortitude must be,
				And in this fearsome sea my way must steer.
				If deprivation come to buffet me,
				And if grim death in agony draws near,
				Oh, succor me, from anguish set me free.

			First Romance of Rizal. Shortly after his graduation from the Ateneo, Rizal, who was the sixteen years old, experienced his first romance – " that painful experience which comes to nearly all adolescents." The girl was Segunda Katigbak, a pretty fourteen –year old Batagueña from Lipa. In Rizal own words: "She was rather short, with eyes that were eloquent and ardent at times and languid at others, rosy-cheeked, with an enchanting and provocative smile that revealed very beautiful teeth, and the air of a sylph; her entire self-diffused a mysterious charm."
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			One Sunday Rizal visited his maternal grandmother who lived in Trozo, Manila. He was accompanied by his fried, Mariano Katigbak Family of Lipa. When old Grandmother was a friend of the Katigbak family of Lipa. When he reached his grandmother's house, he saw other guests. One of whom was an attractive girl, who mysteriously caused his hearty to palpitate with strange ecstasy. She was the sister of his friend Mariano, and her name was Segunda.
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			His grandmother's guests, who were mostly college students, knew of his skill in painting so that they urged him to draw Segunda's portrait. He complied reluctantly and made a pencil sketch of her. "From time to time," he reminisced later, "she looked at me, and I blushed." 
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			Rizal came to know Segunda more intimately during his weekly visits to La Concordia College, where his sister Olimpia was a boarding student. Olimpia was a close friend of Segunda. It was apparent that Rizal and Segunda loved each other. Thiers was indeed "a love at first sight." But it was hopeless since the very beginning because Segunda was already engaged to married to her townmate, Manuel Luz. Rizal, for all his artistic and intellectual prowess, was a shy and timid lover. Segunda had manifested, by insinuation and deeds, her affection for him but he timidly failed to propose.
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			The last time they talked to each other was one Thursday in December, 1877, when Christmas vacation was about to begin. He visited Segunda at La Concordia College to say good-bye because he was going home Calamba the following day. She on her part told him she was also going home one day later. She kept quiet after her brief reply, waiting for him to say something her heart was clamoring to hear.
