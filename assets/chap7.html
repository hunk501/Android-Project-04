		<h3>PARIS TO BERLIN, 1885-87</h3>
		<h5><i>
			"Go to my native land, go foreign flowers.
			Sown by the traveler on his way;
			And there beneath its azure sky,
			Where all of my affections lie;
			There from the weary pilgrim say,
			What faith is his in that land of ours!"
		</i></h5>
		<br>
		<div>
			After completing his studies in Madrid, Rizal went to Paris and Germany in order to specialize in ophthalmology. He particularly chose this branch of medicine because he wanted to cure his mother's eye. He served as assistant to the famous oculists of Europe. He also continued his travels and observations of European life and customs in Paris, Heidelberg, Leipzig, and Berlin. In Berlin, capital of the newly unified Germany, he met and befriended several top German scientists, Dr. Feodor Jagor, Dr. Adolph B. Meyer, Dr. Hans Meyer, and Dr. Rudolph Virchow. His merits as a scientist were recognized by the eminent scientists of Europe.

			<b>In Gay Paris (1885-86)</b>. Shortly after terminating his studies at the Unibersidad Central de Madrid, Rizal, who was then 24 years old and already a physician, decided to go to Paris in order to acquire more knowledge in ophthalmology.
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			On his way to Paris, he stopped at Barcelona to visit his friend, Maximo Viola, a medical student and a member of a rich family of San Miguel, Bulacan. He stated for a week, during which time he befriended Señor Eusebio Corominas, editor of the newspaper La Publicidad and made a crayon sketch of Don Miguel Morayta, owber of La Publicidad and a statesman. He gave Editor Corominas an article on the Carolines Question for publication.
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			In October, 1885, Rizal was living in Paris, where he sojourned for about four months. He worked as an assistant to Dr. Louis de Weckert (1852-1906), leading French ophthalmologist.
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			Outside his working days at Dr. Weckert's clinic, he relaxed visiting the home of the Pardo de Taveras (Trinidad, Felix and Paz) and the studio of his Ilokano friend, Juan Luna. On the album of this girl, he drew a series of sketches on the story of the "The Monkey and the Turtle."
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			At the studio of Luna, Rizal spent many happy hours. He discussed with Luna, the great master of the brush, various problems on art and improved his own painting technique. He helped Luna by posing as model in several paintings. In Luna's canvas "The Death of Cleopatra," Rizal posed as Egyptian priest. In another of Luna's great paintings, "The Blood Compact," Rizal posed as Sikatuna, with Dr. Trinidan Pardo de Tavera taking the role of Legazpi.
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			<b>Rizal as Musician</b>. Music plated an important part in all Filipino reunions in Barcelona, Madrid, Paris, and other cities of Europe. The Filipino contemporaries of Rizal could either play and instrument or sing. Especially, in the home of the Pardo de Tavernas and in the Luna studio, every reunion was enlivened with the playing or singing of the kundiman and other Philippine melodies.
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			Rizal had no natural aptitude for music, and this he admitted. But he studied music because many of his schoolmates in the Ateneo were taking music lessons. In a letter dated November 27, 1878, he told Enrique Lete that he "learned the solfeggio, the piano, and voice culture in one month and a half". However, he confessed that he could not sing well. "If you could hear me sing," he wrote to Lete, "you would say you were in Spain because my voice is like braying of the asses." By the sheer determination and constant practice, Rizal came to play the flute fairly well. He was a flutist in various impromptu reunions of Filipinos in Madrid and Paris.
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			It is said that he composed three musical pieces, namely: (1) the song entitled "Leonor" which he composed before his departure for Spain, (2) "El Canto del Prisionero," a danza, which he composed during his exile in Dapitan and (3) "Alin Mang Lahi," a patriotic hymn.
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			<b>In Historic Heidelberg</b>. After acquiring enough experience as an ophthalmologist in Dr. Wecker's clinic, Rizal reluctantly left gay Paris, where he spent so many happy days. 
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			On February 8, 1886, he arrived in Heidelberg, historic city in Germany famous for its old university and romantic surroundings. For short time he lived in a boarding house with some German law students. These students found out that Rizal was a good chess player so that they recommended him to be a member of the Chess Players' Club. Rizal thus became a member of this chess club, whose members were mostly law students. It is not true, as some biographers say, that he studied law in the University of Heidelberg. He only attended some lecture courses to satiate his thirst for knowledge.
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			Later Rizal lived with a Lutheran minister, Pastor Karl Ullmer. The two became good friends. They had many friendly discussions on the merits of Catholism and Protestantism. Rizal, although a Mason, regarded Catholism as a better religion that Protestantism.
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			In Heidelberg, Rizal worked in the clinic of Dr. Javier Galezowsky (1832-1907), famous Polish ophthalmologist. He also studied under Dr. Otto Becker, great German authority on ophthalmology. In his spare moments, he sketched clever caricatures of what he saw. His caricature of two German boys playing near a pond revealed his talents as cartoonist.
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			"<b>To the Flowers of Heidelberg</b>." During his stay in Heidelberg, Rizal used to wander around, strolling along the cool banks of the Neckar River and admiring the picturesque sceneries of the countrysides. One day, as he roamed around he was attracted by the blooming flowers. Among these flowers was his favorite flower – the light blue "forget me not."
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			The blooming flowers of Heidelberg, with their riotous colors and sweet scent, reminded him of home. In this moment of homesickness, he wrote on April 22, 1886, a fine poem as follows: 
		</div>
		<br>
		<div class="poem">
			<p>TO THE FLOWERS OF HEIDELBERG</p>
			<p>
				Go to my native land, go, foreign flowers,
				Sown by the traveler on his way,
				And there, beneath its azure sky,
				Where all my affections lie;
				There were from the weary pilgrim say,
				What faith is his in that land of ours!
				Go there and tell how when the dawn,
				Her early light diffusing,
			</p>
			<p>
				Your petals first flung open wide;
				His steps beside chill Neckar drawn,
				You see him silent by your side,
				Upon its Spring perennial musing,
				Say how when morning's light,
				All your fragrance` stealing,
				Whispers to you as in mirth,
			</p>
			<p>
				Playful songs of Love's delight,
				He, too, murmurs his love's feeling
				In the tounge he learned at birth.
				That when the sun on Koenigstuhl's height
				Pours out it's golden flood,
				And with its slowly warming light
				Gives life to vale and grove and wood,
				He greets that sun, here only upraising,
				Which in his native land is at its zenith blazing.
				And tell there of that day he stood,
			</p>
			<p>
				Near to a ruin'd castle gray,
				By Neckar's banks, or shady wood,
				And pluck'd you from beside the way
				Tell, too, the tale to you addressed,
				And how with tender care,
				Your bending leaves he press'd
				"Twist pages of some volume rare.
				Bear  then, O flowers, love's message bear;
				My love to all the love'd ones there,
			</p>
			<p>
				Peace to my country –  fruitful land –
				Faith whereon its sons may stand,
				And virtue for its daughters' care;
				All those beloved creatures greet,
				That still around home's altar  meet.
				And when you come unto its shore,
				This kiss I now on you bestow,
				Fling where the winged breezes blow;
			</p>
			<p>
				That borne on them it may hover o'er
				All that I love, esteem, and adore.
				But though, O flowers, you come unto that land,
				And still perchance your colors hold;
				So far from this heroic strand,
				Whose soil first bade your life unfold
				Still here your fragrance will expand;
				Your soul that never quits the earth
				Whose light smiled on you at your birth.
			</p>

			<b>First Letter to Blumentritt</b>.  On July 31, 1886, Rizal wrote his first letter in German to Professor Ferdinand Blumentritt, Director of Ateneo of Leitmeritz, Austria. He had heard of this Austrian ethnologist and his interest on Philippine languages. In his letter, Rizal said:
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			I have heard that you are studying our language, and that you had already published some work about it; permit me to send you a valuable book written by my countryman in our language. The Spanish version is mediocre because the author is only a modest writer but the Tagalog part is good, and it is precisely the language spoken in our province. 
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			With the letter, Rizal sent the book which he mentioned. The book was entitled Arithmetica (Arithmetic) and was published in two languages – Spanish and Tagalog – by the University of Santo Tomas Press in 1868. The author was Rufino Baltazar Hernandez, a native of Santa Cruz, Laguna.
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			Rizal's letter form Heidelberg impressed Blumentritt, who reciprocated by sending Rizal's a gift of two books. It marked the beginning of their long and frequent correspondence, also the beginning of a beautiful friendship that lasted all their lives. Blumentritt, the Austrian, became the best friend of Rizal, the Filipino.
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			<b>Fifth Centenary of Heidelberg University</b>. Rizal was fortunate to be sojourning in Heilderberg when the famous University of Heidelberg held its fifth centenary celebration on August 6 1886. It was two days before his departure, and he was sad because he came to love the beautiful city and its hospitable people.
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			The following entry in his diary dated August 6, 1886 describes the celebration of the fifth centenary of the famous University of Heidelberg:
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			"For its fifth centenary the famous University of Heidelberg celebrated its Festung this morning, and we attended. I liked the picture better that the original itself. There were, however, many elegant and brilliant costumes; Bugmuller, the famous student of Heidelberg, was dressed as Frederick the Victorious; Lieberman, as a gentleman of the seventeenth century; Gregoire, Wolf of Schwahen, etc. Last night was Schlorsfest. When will these gaieties enjoyed in this poetic and beautiful city come back? When will the foreigners return there? When shall I return after I shall have left? Inquire the fate of molecules of water that the sun evaporates. Some fall as dew on the bosoms of the flowers; others are converted into ice and snow; others into mud or swamp or torrential cascade – they are not lost but continue to live in the nature. Will my soul have fate of water – never being lost into nothingness?"
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			<b>Rizal Goes to Leipzig</b>.  On August 8, 1886, two days after the fifth centenary celebration of the University of Heidelberg, Rizal left the city of Heidelberg. He boarded a train, visited various cities in Germany, and arrived in Leipzig on August 14, 1886. He attended some lectures at the University of Leipzig on history and psychology. He befriended Professor Friedrich Ratzel, a famous German Historian.
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			Rizal Stayed in Leipzig from August 14 to October 29, 1886. In this German City, he translated Schiller's William Tell from German to Tagalog in order that Filipinos might know the story of that champion of Swiss independence. Later, he also translated into Tagalog for his nephews and nieces some of Hans Andersen's Fairy Tales.
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			On October 29, he left Leipzig for Dresden, where he met Dr. Adolph B. Meyer, Director of the Anthropological and Ethnological Museum.
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			<b>Rizal Welcomed in Berlin's Scientific Circles</b>. Rizal was enchanted by Berlin because of its scientific atmosphere and the absence of race prejudice. In this city, he came in contact with great scientists. He met for the fist time Dr. Feodor Jagor, celebrated German scientist-traveler and author of Travels in the Philippines, a book which Rizal read and admired during his student days in Manila. Dr. Jagor had been in the Philippines when Rizal was a boy. In his book (published in Berlin in 1873), he foretold the downfall of Spanish rule in the Philippines and the coming of America to Philippine shores. Rizal had a letter of introduction by Blumentritt for Jagor.  
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			Dr. Jagor, in turn, introduced Rizal to Dr. Rudolf Virchow, famous German anthropologist, and his son, Dr. Hans Virchow, professor of Descriptive Anatomy. Rizal also met Dr. Joest, noted German geographer. He worked un the clinic of Dr. R. Schulzer, famous German ophthalmologist.
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			Rizal became a member of Anthropological Society and the Geographical Society of Berlin, upon recommendation of Dr. Meyer and Dr. Jagor. His membership in both scientific societies proved that his scientific knowledge was recognized by Europe's scientists.
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			Dr. Virchow, who recognized Rizal's genius, invited the latter to give a lecture on the Tagalogs before the Anthropological Society of Berlin. In response to Virchow's invitation, Rizal wrote a scholarly paper in German, entitled Tagalische Verskunst (Tagalog Metrical Art) which he read before the society in April, 1887. This paper was published by the society in the same year, and it elicited favorable comments from all scientific quarters.
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			Rizal's Life in Berlin.  In Berlin, Rizal was not a mere student or a curious tourist. He lived in this famous capital of unified Germany for five reasons: (1) to gain further knowledge of ophthalmology, (2) to further his studies of sciences and languages, (3) to observe conditions of German nation, (4) to associate with famous German scientists and scholars, and (5) to finish his novel, Noli Me Tangere. 
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			Rizal led a methodical and frugal life in Berlin. By day, he worked as an assistant in the clinic of Dr, Schulzer (1858-1919), eminent German ophthalmologist. At night, he attended lectures in University of Berlin. At his boarding house, he kept himself in physical trim by daily exercises and practiced speaking German, French, English, and Italian. He wanted to master French so that he may be able to write it as well as Spanish. He took private lessons under a professor of French, Madame Lucie Gerdolle, in order to master the idiomatic intricacies of the French language. Aside from perfecting his academic studies, he attended daily exercises in a Berlin gymnasium to develop his body.
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			He spent his leisure moments touring the countrysides around Berlin, observing keenly the customs, dresses, homes and occupations of the peasants. He made sketches of the things he saw. He also enjoyed promenading along Unter den Linden, the most popular boulevard of Berlin, sipping beer in the city's inns, and talking with the friendly Berliners.
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			Rizal on German Women. One of his important letters written while he was in Germany was that addressed to his sister, Trinidad and dated March 11, 1886. In this letter, Rizal expressed his high regard and admiration of the German womanhood. The German woman, said Rizal to his sister, is serious, diligent, educated and friendly. She is not gossipy, frivolous, and quarrelsome like the Spanish woman. She is not particular about beautiful dresses and expensive jewelries, though she could dress nicely like any other woman in the world.
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			Rizal regretted that in the Philippines, the woman are more interested in how they dress than in how much they know. He praised, however, the delicacy of feeling the fine manners, devotion, and hospitality of the Filipino women, especially those in the provinces who are not yet sophisticated. If only they can cultivate their intellect by education, read more, and take more interest in worldly affairs, remarked Rizal, they can command the respect of all men. Accordingly, Rizal gave and advice to his sister, Trinidad: "Now that you are still young you should strive to read, read, and learn. You must not allow yourself to be conquered by indolence because it costs so little to cast it off."
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			German Customs. Aside from the German women, Rizal admired the German customs which he observed well. It must be noted that he was a keen observer of the customs of the people in all the countries he visited. The Christmas custom of the Germans delighted him most. Of his Yuletide custom, he wrote: "On Christmas eve, the people take from the bushes a pine tree, selecting one which must not only be straight but also must have leaves that do not fall in spring; I mean that dry leaves are not all in this particular case, but are a kind of all small needle. It is adorned with lanterns, papers, lights, dolls, candies, fruits, etc; and shown at night to the children (who had not seen it being prepared). Around this tree is made the family observance."
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			Another interesting German custom observed by Rizal is self-introduction to strangers in a social gathering. In Germany, when a man attends a social function and finds that there is nobody to introduce him to the other guests, he bows his head to the guests, introduce himself and shakes the hands of everyone in the room. According to the German code of etiquette, it is bad manner for a guest to remain aloof, and wait for his host or hostess to make proper introductions.
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			<b>Rizal's Darkest Winter</b>. Rizal spent winters in many temperate countries. The winter of 1886 in Berlin was his darkest winter. During this bleak winter, he lived in poverty because no money arrived from Calamba and he was flat broke. The diamond ring which his sister, Saturnina, gave him was in the pawnshop. Many of his books had already been sold to second-hand book stores. He could not pay his landlord. He had to scrimp, eating only one meal a day. And that daily meal consisted of bread and water or some cheap vegetable soup. His clothes were old and threadbare. He laundered them himself because he could not afford to pay for their dry-cleaning. 
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			Out in far-away Calamba, Paciano tried desperately to raise money. He knew his younger brother was in dire financial situation in Berlin. But the crops have failed due to ravages of the locusts. The sugar market collapsed. Time was if the essence, but poor Paciano was delayed in raising the necessary funds.
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			Meanwhile, Rizal staved in Berlin and shivered with wintry cold. His health broke down due to lack of proper nourishment. He began to cough, and he feared that he was going to be sick of tuberculosis. Never had he suffered such physical blows a penury, so that his soul cried out in despair.
