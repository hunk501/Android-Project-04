		<h3> AT THE UNIVERSITY OF SANTO TOMAS 1877-82</h3>
		<h5><i>
			"O Youth, illumined by the arts and letters, Stride forth into the arena, break down the heavy Fetters that bind your genius down, for in These tropic regions were untutored darkness Once held sway, the wise and kindly Spanish Hand bestows today a splendid crown Upon the native of this Eastern land." --Jose Rizal

			Fortunately, Rizal's tragic First romance, with its bitter disillusionment, did not adversely affect his studies in the University of Santo Tomas. His love for higher education proved to be greater than his love for a pretty girl. After finishing the first year of the course in philosophy and Letters (1877-78), he transferred to the medical course. During the years of his studies in the university, which was under the Dominicans. Rival educators of the Jesuits, he remained loyal to Ateneo, where he continued to participate in extracurricular activities and where he complete the vocation course in surveying. As a Thomasian, he won more literary laurels, had more romances with girls, and fought against Spanish students.
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			<b>Mother's Opposition to Higher Education</b>. After graduating with the highest honors from the Ateneo, Rizal had to go to the University of Santo Tomas in order to prepare himself for a career. The Bachelor of Arts degree during Spanish times was equivalent to a high school diploma today. It merely qualified its holder to enter a university. Both Don Fransisco and Paciano wanted that Jose should pursue higher learning. But Doña Teodora did not want him to study more. Evidently, she had a premonition that too much Knowledge would imperil her son's life.
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			In a family counsil in the Rizal home in Calamba, she vigorously objected to have beloved Jose acquire higher education. She was thinking of the safety of her son. She knew the fate of the Filipino intellectuals—Father Burgos, Dr. Antonio Ma. Regidor, Jose Ma. Basa, and other exiles of 1872—who were either executed or exiled by the Spanish authorities, and she blamed their sad fate to their learning.
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			 Fearful of the Spanish authorities who seemed to frown on those Filipinos who learned too much, she warned her husband. "Do not send Jose again to Manila. If he gets to know too much, they will cut off his head!"
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			 Jose, who was present at the family council when his beloved mother said this, was shocked. He knew her mother was a woman of education and culture; she even taught him and inspired him to write poetry; and she came from a family of high learning—her own brother (and his uncle) Jose Alberto Alonso had been educated abroad and could speak Spanish, French, English, and German. Evidently, Don Fransisco and Paciano were able to overcome Doña Teodora's objection. It was finally decided that Jose would study in the University of Santo Tomas. Years later Rizal remembering his mother's objection to his further studies, wrote in his memoirs: " Did she have a presentiment of what was going to happen to me? Can it be that a mother's heart gives her double vision "
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			<b>Rizal Enters the University</b>. In April, 1877, Rizal, who was then nearly 16 years old, matriculated in the University of Santo tomas taking Philosophy and letters. He enrolled in this course for two reasons: (1) his father liked it and (2) he was "still unsertain as to what career to follow," He had written to Father Pablo Ramon, Rector of the Ateneo, who had been good to him during his student days in that college, asking for advice on the choice of career Unfirtunately, the Father Rector was in Mindanao and during those days it took several months for a letter to travel between Manila and Mindanao. Consequently, during his first year term (1877-78) in the University of Santo Tomas, he studied Cosmology, Metaphysics, Theodicy, and History of Philosophy.
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			 It was during the following school term (1878-79) that Rizal took up medicine, enrolling simultaneously in the preparatory medical course and the regular first year medical course. The reason why he studied medicine were: (1) he wanted to be a physician so that he might cure his mother's failing eyesight and (2) the Father Rector of the Ateneo, whom he consulted for a choice of career, finally answered his letter, recommending medicine.
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			<b>Finishes Surveying Course in Ateneo (1878)</b>. His first school term in the University of Santo Tomas (1877-78), Rizal also studied in the Ateneo. He took the vocational course leading to the title of perito agrimensor (expert surveyor). In those days, it should be remembered, the colleges for boys in Manila offered vocational courses in agriculture, commerce, mechanics, and surveying.
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			Rizal, as usual, excelled in all subjects in the surveying course in the Ateneo, with gold medals in agriculture and topography. At the age of 17, he passed the final examination in the surveying course, but he could not be granted the title was issued to him on November 25 1881.
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			Although Rizal was then Thomasian, he frequently visited the Ateneo. It was due not only to his surveying course, but more because of his loyalty to the Ateneo, where he had so many beautiful memories and whose Jesuits proffesors, unlike the Dominicians, loved him and inspired him to ascend to greater heights of knowledge. He continued to participate actively in the Ateneo's extra-curricular activities. He was president of the academy of Spanish literature and secretary of the Academy of Natural Sciences. He also continued his membership in the Marian Congregation. Of which he was the secretary.
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			<b>Romances with Other Girls</b>. Not with standing his academic studies in the University of Santo Tomas and extracurricular activities in the Ateneo, Rizal had ample time for love. He was a romantic dreamer who liked to sip the "nectar of love." His sad experience with his first love had made him wiser in the ways of romance.
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			 Shortly after losing Segunda Katigbak, he paid court to a young woman in calamba. In his memoirs he called her simply Miss L, describing her as "fair with seductiveand attractive eyes." After visiting her in her house several times, he suddenly stopped his wooing, and this woman was. Rizal himself, did not give her name. Hence, her
		</div>

		<div>
			1 The certificate of Rizal's title as surveyor, according to Dr. Hernandez, is now in the possession of Severino E. Bayani of Cadiz, Occidental Mindoro. (Rizal p.81). Dr.Rafael Palma croneously stated that the surveying title was issued to Rizal on September 30, 1881 (Pride of the Malay Race p.30) Identity is lost to his history. However, he gave two reasons for his change of heart, namely: (1) the sweet memory of Segunda was still in his heart and (2) his father objected to the match.
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			Several months later, during his sophomore year at the University of Santo tomas, he boarded in the house of doña Concha Leyva in Intramuros. The next-door neighbors of Doña concha were Captain Juan and Capitana Sanday Valenzuela, parents of a chairman girl named Leonor. Rizal, te medical student from Calamba, was a welcomed visitor in the Valenzuela, who was a life of the social parties because of his clever sleight-of-hand tricks. He courted Leonor Valenzuela, who was a tall girl, "almost as tall as Jose himself," and had a regal bearing. He sent her love notes written in invisible ink. This ink consisted of common table saltand water. It left no trace on the paper. Rizal, who knew his chemistry, taught Orang (pet name of Leonor Valenzuela) the secret of reading any note written in the invisible ink by heating it over a candle Segunda, he stopped short of proposing marriage to Orang.
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			 Rizal's next romance, which modern writers have glamorized, was with another Leonor---Leonor Rivera--- his cousin from Camiling. In 1879, at the start of his junior year at the university, he lived in "Casa Tomasina," a boarding house managed by his uncle, Antonio Rivera, at No.6 Calle Santo Tomas, Intramuros. His landlord-Uncle had a pretty daughter, Leonor, a student at La Concordia College, where soledad (Rizal's youngest sister) was then studying. Leonor, born in Camiling, Tarlac, on April 11, 1867, was a frail, beautifulromance. They became engaged. In her letters to Rizal, Leonor signed her name as "Taimis," in order to camouflage their intimate relationship from their parents and friends.
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			 <b>Victim of Spanish Officer's Brutality</b>. When Rizal was a freshman medical student at the University of Santo Tomas, he got his first taste of Spanish brutality. One dark night in Calamba, during his summer vacation in 1880, he was walking in the street. He dimly perceived the figure of a man while passing him. Not knowing the person due to darkness, he did not salute nor say a courteous "Good Evening." The vague figure was a lieutenant of the Guardia Civil. With a snarl, he turned upon Rizal, whipped out a sword and brutally slashed the latter on the back.
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			The wound was not serious, but it was painful. When he recovered, Rizal reported the incident to General Primo de Rivera, the Spanish governor-general of the Philippines cause he was an Indio and the abusive lieutenant was a Spaniard. In a letter to Blumentritt, dated March 21, 1887, he related: "I went to the Captain-General but I could obtain no justice; my wound lasted two weeks."

			 "To the Filipino Youth" (1879). In the year 1879 the Liceo Artistico-Literario (Artistic-Literary Lyceum) of Manila, a society of literary men and artists, held a literary contest. It offered a prize for the best poem by native or mestizo. Rizal, who was then eighteen years old, submitted his poem entitled A La Juventud Filipina (To the Filipino Youth).  The board of Judges, compose of Spaniards, was impressed by Rizal's poem and gave it the First prize. This prize was a silver pen, Feather-shaped and decorated with a gold ribbon. Young Rizal was happy to win the poetry contest. He was sincerely congratulated by the Jesuits, especially his former professors in the Ateneo.
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			The prize-winning poem, A La Juventud Filipina, is an inspiring poem of flawless form. In exquisite verse, Rizal beseeched the Filipino youth to "rise from lethargy, to let his genius fly swifter than the wind and descend with art and science to break chain that has long bound the poetic genius of the country," This poem is a follow;

			This winning poem of Rizal is a classic in Philippine literature for two reasons: First great poem in Spanish written by a Filipino, whose merit was recognized by Spanish literary authorities, and second, it gives for the first time a nationalistic concept that the Philippines is the "fatherland of the Filipino."
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			 "The Council of the god's (1880). The following year (1880) the Artistic-literary Lyceum opened another literary contest to commemorate the fourth centennial of the death of Cervantes, Spain's glorified man-of-letters and famous author of Don Quixote. This time the contest was opened to both Filipinos and Spaniards.
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			Many writers participated in the contest---priests, newspapermen, scholars, and professors of the University of Santo Tomas. Rizal, inspired by his poetical triumph the previous year, entered the literary joust, submitting an allegory in prose entitled El Consejo de los Dioses (The Council of the Gods).
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			The judges of the contest were all Spaniards. After a long and critical appraisal of the entries. They were forced to award the prize to Rizal because of its literary superiority over the other. The Spanish community in Manila, spearheaded by the Spanish press howled in great indignation against the decision because the winning author was an Indio. Despite all objections, the prize was awared to Rizal, which was gold ring on which was engraved   the bust of Cervantes. A Spanish writer, D. N. del Puzo, won the second prize. For the first time in history, an Indio—and a nineteen-year old Filipino medical student at that –excelled in a national literary contest, defeating the best Spanish writers of his time in Manila. Rizal was, particularly, happy, for he proved the fallacy of the alleged Spanish superiority over the Filipino and revealed that the Filipino can hold his own in fair competition against all races.
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			The winning allegory of Rizal was a literary masterpiece based on the classics. In writing it, Rizal, although a student of the University of Santo Tomas, was aided The Board of Judges, which was composed of Spaniards, declared: "the idea and plot of the work (The Council of the Gods –Z) are of great originality to which should be added the circumstances that throughout the same shine to the utmost a correct style, a taste so Hellenic that the imagines himself relishing some delicious passage of Homer which with such frequency the Olympic sessions describe to us in their works," (Palma, op. eit., p. 36.)
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			By the kind Father Rector of the Ateneo in securing the needed reference materials. "The allegory established a parallel among homer, Virgil, and Cervantes. The gods discuss the comparative merits of these different bards and finally decide to give the trumpet to homer, the lyre to Virgil, and the laurel to Cervantes. The allegory fittingly and gloriously closes with the naiads, nymphs, satyrs, and other mythological characters dancing and gathering myrrh and laurel for Cervantes."
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			 <b>Other Rizalian Literary Works</b>. Aside from the two prize-winning works mentioned above, Rizal, although studying medicine, produced other poems and a drama. The drama was Junto al Pasig (Beside the pasig ), which was staged by the Ateneans on December 8, 1880, on the occasion of the annual celebration of the Feast Day of the Immaculate Conception, Patroness of the Ateneo. It was a melodrama, which he wrote as President of the Academy of Spaniish Literature in the Ateneo.
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			As piece of literature Junto al Pasig is mediocre. But there are passages in it which express in subtle satire the author's nationalist ideas. For instance, Rizal makes Satan say that the Philippines---

		<div class="poem">
			<p>"Now without comfort,
                                                  Sadly groans in the power of a foreign people.
                                                  An slowly dies

		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			In the same year (1880), he wrote a sonnet entitled A Filipinas in the album of the Society of Sculptors. In this sonnet, he urged all Filipino artists to glorify the Philippines. The year before, in 1879, he composed a poem entitled Abd-el-Azis y Mahoma,which was declaimed by an Atenean, Manuel Fernandez, on the night of December 8, 1879 in honor of the Ateneo's Patroness.
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			Later, in 1881, he composed a poem entitled Al M.R.P. Pablo Ramon, Rector del Ateneo, en Sus Dias. He wrote this poem as an Expression of affection to Father Pablo Ramon, the Ateneo rector, who had been so kind and helpful to him.

			Champion of Filipino Students. Rizal was the champion of the Filipino students in their frequents fights against the arrogant Spanish students, who were often surpassed by the Filipino in class work, insultingly called their brown classmates—"Indio, chongo!"The latter retaliated by calling them "kastila, bangus!" Hostility between these two groups of students often explode in hectic street brawls.
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			 Rizal participated in these student brawls. Owing to his skill in fencing, his prowess in wrestling, and his indomitable courage, he was particularly conspicuous in many fights. His three close friends, fired by Dumas' novel called themselves "The three Musketeers" and chose him as trevilled, their chief. He was also the chief of a secret society of Filipino students, called Compañerismo (Comradeship), which he organized in 1880.Galicano Apacible was secretary of this secret student organization. The members called themselves "Companions of Jehu."
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			 In one of the fierce encounters between the Filipino students and their pale-skinned detractors near the Escolta, Rizal was wounded on the head. His friends brought him bleeding and covered with dust to his boarding house, "Casa Tomasina." Leonor Rivera Tenderly washed and dressed his wound.
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			<b>Rizal's Unhappy Days at UST. Rizal</b>, Ateneo's boy wounder, found the atmosphere at the University of Santo Tomas suffocating to his sensitive spirit. He was unhappy at this Dominican instilution of high learning because (1) the Dominican professors were hostile to him, (2) The Filipino students were racially discriminated, and (3) the method of instruction was obsolete and repressive.
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			In his novel, El Filibusterismo, he described how the Filipino students were humiliated and insulted by their Dominican professors and how backward was the method of instruction, especially in the teaching of natural sciences. He related in Chapter XIII of his novel, entitled "The Class in Physics," that this science subject was taught without laboratory experiments. The microscope and other laboratory apparatus were kept inside the showcases to be seen by visitors, but the students could not even touch them.
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			In Rizal's time, the Filipino thirst for knowledge was not encouraged by Dominican professors in the University of Santo Tomas. Because of the unfriendly attitude of his professors, Rizal, the most brilliant graduate of the Ateneo, failed to win high scholastic honors. Although his grades in the first year of the philosophy course were all "excellent," they were not impressive in the four years of medicine. His scholastic records in medicine (1878-1882) are as follows:

			Decision to Study Abroad.  After finishing the fourth year of his medical course, Rizal decided to study in Spain. He could no longer endure the rampant bigotry, discrimination, and hostility in the University of Santo Tomas. His uncle, Antonio Rivera, Leonor's father, encouraged him to go abroad. Both Paciano and Saturnina, whom he contacted secretly, were of similar opinion.
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			For the first time, Rizal did not seek his parents' that they, especially his mother, would disapprove his plan. He did not also bring his beloved Leonor at that, could not keep a secret. Thus, Rizal's parents, Leonor, and the Spanish authorities knew nothing of his decision to go abroad in order to finish his medical studies in Spain, where the professor were more tolerant and understanding than those of the University of Santo Tomas.
