			Dr. Jose Rizal Mercado y Alonso, or simply Jose Rizal (1861-1896), is unquestionably the greatest hero and martyr of our nation. The day his birth and the day of his execution are fittingly commemorated by all classes of our people throughout the length and breadth of his country and even by Filipino home while his pictures adorns the postage stamp and paper and coin money of widest circulation.

			No other Filipino hero can surpass Rizal in the number of monuments erected in his honor, in the number of towns, barrios, barangays and streets named after him, in the number of educational institutions, societies, and trade names that bear his name, in the number of persons, both Filipinos and foreigners, who were named "Rizal" or "Rizalina" because of their parent's admiration for the great Malayan, and number of laws, Executive Orders and Proclamations of the Chief Executive, and bulletins, memoranda, and circulars of both the bureaus of public and private schools.

			Who is the Filipino writer and thinker whose teaching and noble thoughts have been frequently invoked and quoted by authors and public speakers on almost all occasions? None but Rizal. They are as valid today as they were yesterday. It cannot be said that because the political ideals of Rizal have been achieved, because of the change of institutions, the wisdom of his counsels or the value of his doctrines have ceased to be opportune.
