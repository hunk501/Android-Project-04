			<b>DR. JOSE RIZAL</b>, the greatest hero of the Philippines, was a "many-splendored" genius. He was richly dowered by God with superb intellectual, moral, and physical qualities. Truly, he ranks with the world's genius. He was an anthropologist, botanist, businessman, cartographer, dramatist, economist, educator, engineer, essayist, entomologist, ethnologist, farmer, folklorist, geographer, grammarian, historian, horticulturist, humorist, lexicographer, linguist, musician, novelist, painter, physician, poet, philologist, philosopher, polemist, psychologist, satirist, traveler, and zoologist. More than all these, he was a patriot, hero, and martyr. Unlike many geniuses, he consecrated his God-given talents, and even sacrificed his own life for this redemption and welfare of his people. Verily, a man of his heroism and versatility appears but once in the history of any nation.

		<div>
			<b>The World When Rizal Was Born</b>. In 1861, the year when Rizal was born, The Philippines was browsing redolently beneath the shadow of the Cross. Pax Hispanica reign over the entire archipelago. The people, despite and Christian way of life. Comparatively speaking, they were better off than the subject peoples in the English, Dutch, and Portuguese colonies during that age. The Spanish governor-general then was a good militarist, General Jose Lemery, whose achievement worthy of historical citation was the establishment of the Politico-Military Government of the Visayas and Mindanao. No bloody Muslim piratical aid, no serious native upspring, no frightful upsurge of banditry, and no threat of foreign invasion marred the general tranquility of the land.
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			Beyond the frontiers of the Philippines, the world was seething in the throes of political strifes, social upheavals, and international intrigues. Gargantuan China was prostrate, impotent to stop the predatory Western powers who were busy looting her riches. Her futile wars with England and France were ended by infamous "Conventions of Peking" (October 22, 1860), in which she lost more territories and was forced to grant more commercial concessions to the imperialist "foreign devils." To worsen matters for the tottering Manchu dynasty, Taiping Rebellion (1850-1864) was ravaging the rich provinces south of the Yangtze.

		<div>
			<b>The Birth of A Hero</b>. Near midnight of Wednesday, June 19, 1861, when the Philippines was in deep slumber, a frail baby boy was born to the Rizal family in Calamba Laguna. It was a moonlit night, being " a few days the full of the moon." The delivery was exceedingly difficult, and her mother almost died. Her seemingly miraculous survival was attributed to Our Lady of Peace and Good Voyage.
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			The baby boy was baptized by Rev. Rufino Collantes in the Catholic church of Calamba on June 22, 1861, three after his birth. His godfather was Rev. Pedro Casana. He was named "Jose" by his pious mother, in honor of St. Joseph. It was customary for Catholic parents to name their children after the saints.
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			The full name of the baby boy, who was destined to become the greatest genius and hero of the Philippines was, Jose Protasio Rizal Mercado y Alonzo Realonda
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			Jose was the seventh of the eleventh children of Francisco Mercado Rizal and Teodora Alonzo Realonda. Both mother and father were model Filipino parents – devoutly religious, educated, industrious, affectionate but strict, hospitable and civic-spirited.
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			The hero's father, Francisco (1818-1898), was born in Binan, Laguna, on May 11, 1818 and died in Manila on January 5. 1898, at the age of 80. He was an educated farmer having studied Latin and Philosophy at the College of San Jose in Manila. In early manhood, after his mother's death, he moved to Calamba and became a tenant-farmer of the Dominican estate. He married a college-bred Manilena, Teodora Alonzo Realonda, on June 28, 1848. Dr. Rizal, his greatest child, affectionately called him "a model of fathers." He was quiet, serious, frugal man, taller than the average Filipino, with wide shoulders, brown complexions, prominent forehead, large dark eyes, large ears, and firm jaws.
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			The hero's mother, Teodora (1826-1911), was born in Manila on November 8, 1926 and died on August 16, 1911, at age of 85. A graduate of Santa Rosa College, she was a talented woman with high culture, business ability and literary gift. Dr. Rizal, loving her as much as his father, said of her: "My mother is more than a woman of ordinary culture; she knows literature and speaks Spanish better than I… She is a mathematician and has read many books." Aside from helping her husband in farming and business, she looked after the education and moral training of her numerous children

		<br>

			<b>Ancestry of Rizal</b>. Jose Rizal, like a typical Filipino, was of mixed ancestry. In his veins flowed the bloods of both East and West – Negrito, Indonesian, Malay, Chinese, Japanese, and Spanish.
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			Rizal's paternal great-great-grandfather was a Chinese named Domingo Lam-co, a native of Chinchew, a China's City of Spring." His father Francisco, was a great-grandson of Lam-co. Both his father's father and grandfather had ben Capitanes (town mayors) of Binan.
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			It is said that on the maternal side, Rizal's ancestor was Lakan-Dula, last Malayan king of Tondo. A maternal great-great-grandfather was Eugenio Ursua, of Japanese blood. Jose's mother Teodora belonged to the clan of gifted men. Her brothers Gregorio, Manuel, and Jose were men of unusual talents. Her father, Lorenzo Alberto Alonzo, was an engineer who was awarded by Spain with the coveted decoration of "Knight of the Grand Order of Isabela the Catholic." Her maternal grandfather was Manuel de Quintos, a prominent Manila lawyer. Her paternal grandfather, Cipriano Alonso, was a captain of Binan. In 1849, when the governor Narciso Claveria ordered to Filipino families to choose new surnames from a list of Spanish family names, the children of Lorenzo Alberto Alfonso adopted the name "Realonda." Hence Teodora Alonso became Teodora Alonso Realonda.
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			The Name "Rizal". The original name of the Rizal family was "Mercado." It was a surname adopted in 1781 by Domingo Lam-co, the paternal Chinese ancestor. In English, it means "market". Evidently, Lam-co liked it because it appealed to his business nature and also because it reminded him of his Chinchew ancestors who were mostly merchants.
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			In the year 1849, as mentioned above, Governor Claveria issued a decree directing all Filipino families to choose new surnames from a list of Spanish family names. The purpose of this gubernatorial decree was to Hispanize the Filipino surnames which were difficult for Spanish authorities to pronounce, much less to remember.
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			Jose's father, Francisco, scanned the list of Spanish surnames sent to Calamba such as "Cruz", "Santos", "Ramos", "Rivera", etc. He did not like these surnames. Being a man of independent character, he chose his own surname Rizal, which was not in the list recommended by the Spanish authorities. He considered this new family name as more fitting for his farming clan than Mercado which signifies "market".
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			The term "Rizal" came from the Spanish word <i>ricial</i> which means "green field" or "new pasture".
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			The Rizal Family. The Rizal family was one of the richest families in Calamba during the times prior to its prosecution by the friars. Rizal's parents, by their industry and frugality, were able to honestly build up a large fortune. By present-day standards, they were rich. They were the first to build a large stone house in Calamba, the first to own a carruaje (horse-drawn carriage), the first to have a home library (estimated to consist of more than 1,000 volumes) and the first to educate their children in the colleges of Manila.
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			The Rizal family raised rice, corn, and sugar on large tracts of land rented from Dominican estate of Calamba. It operated a sugar mill, a flour mill, and a homemade ham press. It engaged successfully in the dye and sugar business and in the barter trade (exchange of products with other towns).
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			Teodora, the hero's mother, owned a store in town which sold many articles of trade needed by the people. She was a successful businesswoman and the profits of this store augmented the family income.
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			In due time, the Rizal family was able to purchase another stone house in Calamba. This was another proof of the family affluence.
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			Not only was the Rizal family one of Calamba's richest family; it was, withal, highly esteemed and respected. Combining wealth and culture, hospitality and charm, it participated in all social religious activities in the community.
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			Don Francisco and Dona Teodora were gracious hosts to all visitors—priests, alferez (lieutenant of the Guardia Civil), Spanish officials and Filipinos – during holidays, such as Christmas, town fiests, and other occasions. Beneath the Rizal roof, all guests, irrespective of their color, social position, or economic status, were treated equally – with all courtesy and hospitality.
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			The Rizal Home. The house of the Rizal family was one of the distinguished stone houses in Calamba during the Spanish times. It was rectangular in shape, "of adobe stone and hardwood with a red-tiled roof." Behind it were the poultry yard full of turkeys and chickens and the garden of tropical fruit trees – atis, balimbing, macopa, papaya, santol, tampoy, etc.
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			It was a happy home where parental affection and children's laughter reigned. By day, it hummed with the jubilant noises of the children at play. By night, it echoed with the dulcet notes of family prayers. Both parents and children were harmoniously united by strong ties of affection and understanding.
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			Such a wholesome home, naturally, bred a wholesome family. And such a family was the Rizal family.
