		<h3>Childhood Days in Calamba</h3>
		<h5><i>"Ah, tender childhood, lovely town, Rich fount of my felicities."</i></h5>
		<br>
		<div>
			Jose Rizal, like many Filipino boys, had many beautiful memories of childhood. His was a happy
			home, filled with parental affection, impregnated with family home, filled with parental affection,
			impregnated with family joys, and sanctified by prayers. In the midst of such peaceful, refined, godloving
			family, he spent the early years of his childhood. The beauties of his life was truly his childhood
			days in his natal town.
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			Calamba, "Cradle of a Genius." The town of Calamba is situated on a verdant plain by the
			rippling Laguna de Bay. A few kilometers to the south looms the legendary Mt. Makiling, and beyond
			this mountain lies the coffee-producing Batangas. North of the town spreads the laguna de bay, "a lake of
			poems and songs", with many sailboats gliding by the somnoient Talim island and numerous birds flying
			in the azure skies. Beyond the lake, to the far distance in the north is antipolo, the famous mountain shrine of the miraculous Lady of Peace and Good Voyage.
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			Calamba, with its fertile fields of rice and sugarcane, its evermore green meadows of innumerable
			fruit trees and bananas, its singing birds abounding in lake, river, and fields, its starry nights "filled with the poetry of sadness," its lovely sunrises over lake and mountains, and its charming panoramic views, is a fit place to nurture a growing child. So it came to pass that it became the "cradle of a genius
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			Rizal loved Calamba with all his heart and soul. In 1876, when he was 15 years old and was a
			student in the Ateneo, he remembered his beloved town. Accordingly, he wrote a poem Un Recuerdo A
			Mi Pueblo (In Memory of My Town), as follows:
		</div>
		<br>
		<div class="poem">
			<i>When early Childhood's happy days
			In memory I see once more
			Along the lovely verdant shore
			That meets a gently murmuring sea;</i>
		</div>
		<br>
		<div class="poem"><i>
			When I recall the whisper soft
			Of zephyrs dancing on my brow
			With cooling sweetness, even now
			New luscious life is born in me.
		</i></div>
		<br>
		<div class="poem"><i>
			When I behold the lily white
			That sways to do the wind's command,
			While gently sleeping on the sand
			The stormy water rests awhile;
			When from the flowers there softly breathes
			A bouquet ravishingly sweet,
			Out-poured the newborn dawn to meet,
			As on us she begins to smile.
		</i></div>
		<br>
		<div class="poem"><i>
			With sadness I recall . . . recall
			Thy face, in precious infancy,
			Oh mother, friend most dear to me,
			Who gave to life a wondrous charm.
			I yet recall a village plan,
			My joy, my family, my boon,
			Besides the freshly cool lagoon,
			The spot for which my heart beats warm.
		</i></div>
		<br>
		<div class="poem"><i>
			Ah yes! My footsteps insecure
			In your dark forests deeply sank;
			And there by every river's bank
		</i></div>
		<br>
		<div class="poem"><i>
			I found refreshment and delight;
			Within that rustic temple prayed
			With childhood's simple faith unfeigned
			While cooling breezes, pure, unstained,
			Would send my heart on rapturous flight.
		</i></div>
		<br>
		<div class="poem"><i>
			I saw the Maker in the grandeur
			Of your ancient hoary wood,
			Ah, never in your refuge could
			A mortal by regret be smitten;
			And while upon your sky of blue
			I gaze, no love nor tenderness
			Could fail, for here on nature's dress
			My happiness itself was written.
		</i></div>
		<br>
		<div class="poem"><i>
			Ah, tender childhood, lovely town,
			Rich fount of my felicities,
			Oh those harmonious melodies
			Which put to flight all dismal hours,
			Come back to my heart once more!
			Come back, gentle hours, I yearn!
			Come back as the birds return,
			At the budding of the flowers!
		</i></div>
		<br>
		<div class="poem"><i>
			Alas, farewell! Eternal vigil I keep
			For thy peace, thy bliss, and tranquility
			O Genius of good, so kind!
			Give me these gifts, with charity.
			To thee are my fervent vows,-
			To thee I cease not to sigh
			These to learn, and I call to the sky
			To have thy sincerity.
		</i></div>

			<b>Earliest Childhood Memories.</b> The first memory of Rizal, in his infancy, was his happy
			days in the family garden when he was three years old. Because he was a frail, sickly, and undersized
			child, he was given the tenderest care by his parents. His father built a little nipa cottage in the garden for him to play in the daytime. A kind old woman was employed as an aya (maid) to look after his comfort. At times, he was left alone to muse on the beauties of nature or to play by himself. In his boyhood memoirs, he narrated how he, at the age of three, watched from his garden cottage, the culiauan, the maya, the maria-capra, the martin, the pipit, and other birds, listening "with wonder and joy" to their twilight songs.
		</div>
		<img src="img2.jpg" style="width:100%; height:auto;">
		<div>
			Another childhood memory was the daily Angelus prayer. By nightfall, Rizal related, his mother
			gathered all the children at the house to pray the Angelus.With nostalgic feeling, he also remembered the happy moonlit nights at the azotea after the nightly rosary. The aya related to the Rizal children (including Jose) many stories about the fairies; tales of buried treasure and trees blooming with diamonds, and other fabulous stories. The imaginary tales told by the aya aroused in Rizal an enduring interest in legends ang folklore. Sometimes, when he did not like to take his supper, the aya would threaten him that the asuang, the nuno, the tigbalang, or a terrible bearded and turbaned Bombay would come to take him away if he would not eat his supper.
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			Another memory of his infancy was the nocturnal walk in the town, especially when there was a
			moon. The aya took him for a walk in the moonlight by the river, where the trees cast grotesque shadows
			on the bank. Recounting this childhood experience, Rizal wrote: "Thus my heart fed on somber and
			melancholy thoughts so that even while still a child, I already wandered on wings of fantasy in the high
			regions of the unknown.
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			<b><i>First Sorrow.</i></b> The Rizal children were bound were bound together by ties of love and
			companionship. They were well-bred, for their parents taught them to love one another, to behave
			properly in the presence of elders, to be truthful and religious, and to help one another. They
			affectionately called their father Tatay, and their mother Nanay.
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			Jose was jokingly called Ute by his brother and sisters. The people in Calamba knew him as Pepe
			or Pepito. Jose was closest to his older brother Paciano. Between the two brothers sprang a strong bond of
			friendship, stronger than mere blood brotherhood. Paciano loved his younger brother and was pround of
			his genius. On the other hand, Jose respected Paciano, regarding him almost his second father.
			Of his sisters, Jose loved most the little Concha (Concepcion). He was one year older than
			Concha. He played with her, and from her he learned the sweetness of brotherly love.
			Unfortunately, Concha died of sickness in 1865 when she was only tree years old. Jose, who was
			very fond of her, cried bitterly to lose her. "When I was four years old," he said, "I lost my little sister Concha, and then for the little concha brought him his first sorrow.
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			<b>Devoted Son of Church.</b> Young Rizal was a religious boy. A scion of Catholic clan, born
			and bred in a whole some atmosphere of Catholicism, and possessed of an inborn pious spirit, he grew up
			as a good Catholic. At the age of three, he began to take part in the family prayers. His mother, who was a devout Catholic, taught him the Catholic prayer. When he was five years old, he was able to read haltingly the Spanish family Bible. He loved to go to church, to pray, to take part in novenas, and to join the religious processions. "He was so seriously devout that he was laughingly called Manong Jose by Hermanos ang Hermanas Terceras."
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			Evidence of his fervent Catholic spirit is seen in the poems which he wrote during his boyhood,
			such as Al Nino Jesus (1876), La Alianza Intima Entre La Religión y La Buena Educación (1876), and A
			La Virgen Maria, (no date). When he was studying in Biñan, Laguna (1870-71), he often heard Mass in the parish church at 4:00 A.M. He started his life as a student in the Ateneo in June, 1872 with a prayer, continued it with daily prayers, and ended it with a prayer. One of the men he esteemed and respected in Calamba during his boyhood was the scholarly Father Leoncio Lopez, the town priest. He used to visit this learned Filipino priest and listened to his stimulating opinions on current events and sound philosophy of life.
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			<b>Pilgrimage to Antipolo.</b> On June 6, 1868, Jose and his father left in Calamba to go on
			pilgrimage to Antipolo, in order to fulfill his mother's vow which was made when Jose was born. Doña
			Teodora could not accompany them because she had just given birth to Trinidad.
			It was the first trip of Jose across Laguna de Bay and his first pilgrimage to Antipolo. He and his
			father rode in a casco (barge). He was thrilled, as a typical boy should, by his first lake voyage. He did not sleep the whole night as the casco sailed towards the Pasig River because he was awed by "the
			magnificence of the watery expanse and the silence of the night." Writing many years later of this
			experience, he said: "With that pleasure I saw the sun rise! It was the first time I had seen the bright ray strike, with dazzling effect, the rough surface of the vast lake." After praying at the shrine of the Virgin of Antipolo, Jose and his father went to Manila. It was the first time Jose visited Manila. They went to Santa Ana and visited Saturnina, who was then a student in La Concordia College.
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			<b>First Education from Mother.</b> Jose's first teacher was his mother. A woman of good
			character and fine education, Doña Teodora was a splendid teacher. At the age of three, Jose learned the
			alphabet and the prayers from her. "My mother," said Rizal, "taught me how to read and to say haltingly
			the humble prayers which prayers which I raised fervently to God." She was patient and loving, but strict
			as tutor.
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			Rizal sincerely respected and esteemed Father Lopez, whom he depicted as "Padre Florentino" in el Filibusterismo. There was a time, however, when they quarreled, almost break up their beautiful friendship. One day while Rizal, then age 14, was vacationing in calamba, Doña Teodora proudly showed father lopes a poem written by her son in the ateneo. The old priest read
			it, and remarked that her son must have copied it from a book of poerty because it was too good to be written by a mere lad. Rizal, who was present, felt insulted and answered the venerable priest in violent language, for which he was reprimanded by his mother. A few months later, father lopez, having learned from the Jesuit professors that Rizal could write exquisite poetry, made a special trip to manila, visited his young friend at the Ateneo, and apologized to him for for doubting his ability to write good
			verses. (Rizal to Blumentritt, Ghent, August 23, 1891 in Epistolario Rosalino, Vol. V. Part II, P. 601.)
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			Seeing that her body had a talent for poetry, she encouraged him to write poems. She gave him all her
			love and all that she learned in collage. But when he misbehaved, she spanked him with her slipper. At
			one time Jose, at the age of five, refused to wear a sinamay camisa because it was disobedience. After the
			whipping, Jose wore the coarse camisa without protest.
			At another time while the parents were having their regular siesta, Jose and Josefa played in the
			garden. Jose ignited a fuse attached to a bottle of powder. Soon a loud explosion rent the quiet afternoon, followed by a scream of pain. Doña Teodora who was suddenly awakened by the commotion in the
			garden, saw the crying Josefa with a burnt face. She gave Jose another spanking. Notwithstanding the whippings administered by Doña Teodora, Jose loved his mother and was appreciative of many things he learned from her. Years later, in retrospection of his childhood memories, he wrote: "Surely, a man owes everything to his mother, next to God."
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			<b>The Story of the moth.</b> Of the stories told by Doña Teodora to Jose, that of the young
			moth made the profoundest impression on him. Speaking of this incident. Rizal wrote:
			One night, all the family. Except my mother and my-self, went to bed early. Why, I do not know, but we
			two remained sitting alone. The candles had already been put out. They had been blown out in their globes by means of a curved tube of tin. That tube seemed to me the finest and most wonderful plaything in the world. The room was dimly lighted by a single light of coconut oil. In all Filipino homes such a light burns through the night in goes out just at day-break to awaken people by its spluttering.
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			My mother was teaching me to read in a Spanish reader called "The children's Friend" (El Amigo de los
			Niños). This was quite a rare book and an old copy. It had lost its cover and my sister had cleverly made a new one. She had fastened a sheet of thick blue paper over the back and then covered it with a piece of cloth.
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			This night my mother became impatient with hearing me read so poorly. I did not understand Spanish and
			so I could not read with expression. She took the book from me. First she scolded me for drawing funny pictures on its pages. Then she told me to listen and she began to read. When her sight was good, she read very well. She could recite well, and she understood verse-making, too many times during Christmas vacations, may mother corrected my poetical compositions, and she always made valuable criticisms.
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			I listened to her full of childish enthusiasm. I mar-velled at the nice-sounding phrases which she read from those same pages. The phrases she read so easily stopped me at every breath. Perhaps I grew tired of listening to sounds that had no meaning for me. Perhaps I lacked self-control. Anyway, I paid little attention to the reading. I was watching the cheerful flame. About it, some little moths were circling in playful flights. By chance, too, I yawned. My mother soon noticed that I was not interested. She stopped reading. Then she said to me: "I am going to read you a very pretty story. Now pay attention."
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			On hearing the word ‘story' I at once opened my eyes wide. The word ‘story' promised something new and
			wonderful. I watched my mother while she turned the leaves of the book, as if she were looking for something. Then I settled down to listen. I was full of curiosity and wonder I had never even dreamed that there were stories in the old book which I read without understanding. My mother began to read me the fable of the young moth and the old one. She translated it into Tagalog a little at a time.
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			My attention increased from the first sentence. I looked toward the light and fixed my gaze on the moths
			which were circling around it. The story could not have been better timed. My mother repeated the warning of the old moth. She dwelt upon it and directed it to me. I heard her but it is a curious thing that the light seemed to me each time more beautiful, the flame more attractive. I really envied the fortune of the insects. They frolicked so joyously in its enchanting splendor that the one which had fallen and been drowned in the oil did not cause me any dread.
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			My mother kept on reading and I listened breathlessly. The fate of the two insects interested me greatly.
			The flame rolled its golden tongue to one side and a moth which this movement had singed fell into the oil fluttered for a time and then became quiet. That became for me a great event. A curious change came over me which I have always noticed in myself whenever anything has go farther away and my mother's words sounded strange and uncanny. I did not notice when she ended the fable. All my attention was fixed on the fate of the insect. I watched it with my whole soul… It had died a martyr to its illusion.
			As she put me to bed, my mother said: "see that you do not behave like the young moth. Don't be
			disobedient, or you may get burnt as it did.' I do not know whether I answered or not… The story revealed to me things until then unknown. Moths no longer were, for me, insignificant insects. Moths talked: they knew how to warn. They advised just liked my mother. The light seemed to me more beautiful. It had grown more dazzling and more attractive. I knew why the moths circled the flame.
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			The tragic fate of the young moth, which "died a martyr to its illusions," left a deep impress on Rizal's
			mind. He justified such noble death, asserting that "to sacrifice One's life for it," meaning for an ideal, is "worth while." And, like that young moth, he was fated to die as a martyr for noble ideal.
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			<b>Rizal's three uncles.</b> There were three uncles, brothers of his mother, who played a great part
			in the early education of Rizal. They were Gregorio, Jose, and Manuel Alberto Alonso (after 1849 the
			family name was changed to Realonda). Uncle Gregorio was a lover of books. He instilled into the mind of his precocious nephew (Jose) a great love for books. He taught him to work hard, to think for himself, and to observe life keenly. Uncle Jose, who had been educated at Calcutta, India, was the youngest brother of Doña Teodora. He encouraged his nephew to paint, sketch, and sculpture. Uncle Manuel was big, strong, and husky man. He looked after the physical training of his sickly and weak nephew. He encouraged young Rizal to learn swimming, fencing, wrestling, and other sports, so that in later years Rizal's frail body acquired agility, endurance, and strength.
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			<b>Artistic Talents.</b> Since early childhood Rizal revealed his God-given talents for that arts.
			He drew sketches and pictures on his books and on the books of his sisters, for which reason he was
			scolded by his mother. He carved figures of animals and persons out of wood. Even before he learned
			how to read, he could already sketch pictures of birds, flower, fruits, river, mountains, animals and
			persons. It is said that one day, when Jose was a mere boy in Calamba, a religious banner which was
			always used during the fiesta was spoiled; to replace it, he painted in oil colors a new banner that
			delighted the town folks because it was better than the original one. Jose had the soul of a genuine artist. Rather an introvert child, with a skinny physique and sad dark eyes, he found great joy looking at the blooming flowers, the ripening fruits, the dancing waves of the lakes, and the milky clouds in the sky; and listening to the songs of the birds, the chirpings of the cicadas, and the murmurings of the breezes. He loved to ride on a spirited pony (which his father bought for him) or take long walks in the meadows and lakeshore with his big black dog named Usman. In his room, he kept many statuettes which he made out of clay and wax. At one time, his sisters teased him: "Ute, what are you doing with so many statuettes?"
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			He replied: "Don't you know that people will erect monuments and statues in my honor in the
			future?" These are indeed prophetic words from the lips of a little boy.
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			Aside from painting, sketching, sculpture, and woodcarving, Jose had a gift for magic. His nimble
			fingers and supple wrist could perform many tricks which dazzled the eyes of the onlookers. He
			entertained the Calamba folks and his friends in school with his clever sleights-of-hand and magic
			lanterns.
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			<b>Prodigy of the Pen.</b> Not only was little Jose skilled in brush, chisel, and pen-knife, but also in
			pen. He was a born poet. His mother encouraged him to write poetry. At an early age when children
			usually begin to learn their A, B, C, he was already writing poems. The first known poem that he wrote was a Tagalog poem entitled Sa Aking Mga Kabata (To My Fellow Children). He wrote it in appeal to our people to love our national language. It runs as follows:
		</div>
		<br>
		<div class="poem"><i>TO MY FELLOW CHILDREN</i></div>
		<br>
		<div class="poem"><i>
			Whenever people of a country truly love
			The language which by heav'n they were taught to use,
			That country also surely liberty pursues
			As does the bird which soars to freer space above.
		</i></div>
		<br>
		<div class="poem"><i>
			For language is the final judge and referee
			Upon the people in the land where it holds away;
			In truth our human race resembles in this way
			The other living being born in liberty.
		</i></div>
		<br>
		<div class="poem"><i>
			Whoever knows not how to love his native tongue
			Is worse than any beast or evil smelling fish.
			To make our language richer ought to be our wish
			The same as any mother loves to feed her young.
		</i></div>
		<br>
		<div><i>
			Tagalog and the Latin language are the same
			And English and Castilian and the angels' tongue,
			And God, whose watchful care o'er all is flung,
			Has given us His blessing in the speech we claim,
		</i></div>
		<br>
		<div class="poem"><i>
			Our mother tongue, like all the highest that we know
			Had alphabet and letters of its very own;
			But these were lost – by furious waves were overthrown
			Like bancas in the stormy sea, long years ago.
		</i></div>
		<br>
		<div>
			Rizal must have written other poems than the one mentioned above during his early boyhood in
			Calamba. Unfortunately, such other poems have been lost to posterity. They might had been scribbled on
			notebooks or loose sheets of papers. Rizal, himself, related that he wrote poems when he was a little boy
			and his mother, who knew versification, corrected them for him.
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			Before he was eight years old, he wrote a Tagalog drama. This drama was staged in Calamba in
			connection with the town fiesta. It so happened that the gobernadorcillo (municipal mayor) of Paete, a
			town in Laguna famous for delicious lanzones, witnessed the play and was favorably two pesos, and had
			it staged during the fiesta celebration in Paeta.
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			Two pesos at that time was quite a big sum for a boy of less than eight years old. Such amount
			then was equivalent to one-half month's earning of common laborer. Jose, of course, did not need the
			money because his well-to-do parents could easily give him much more than that. But it was the first
			money he earned in his. Life by means of his pen. Evidently, he was inspired to develop his literary talent.
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			<b>Lakeshore Reveries.</b> During the twilight hours of summertime Rizal, accompanied by his pet
			dog, used to meditate at the shore of Laguna de Bay on the sad conditions of oppressed people. Years
			Later, he related:
		</div>
		<br>
		<div class="poem"><i>
			I spent many, many hours of my childhood down on
			What was beyond. I was dreaming of what might be over
			On the other side of the waves. Almost every day, in our
			Town, we saw the Guardian Civil lieutenant caning and injuring
			Some unarmed and inoffensive villagers. The villager's
			Only fault was that while at a distance he had not
			Taken off his hat and made his bow. The alcalde treated
			The poor villagers in the same way whenever he visited us.
		</i></div>
		<br>
		<div class="poem"><i>
			We saw no restraint put upon brutality. Acts of violence
			And other excesses were committed daily… I asked
			Myself if, the land which lay across the lake, the people
			Lived in this sane way, I wondered if there they tortured
			Any countryman with hard and cruel whips merely on
			Suspicion. Did they there respect the home? Or yonder
			Also, in order to live in peace, would one have to bribe
			Tyrants?
		</i></div>
		<br>
		<div>
			Young that he was, he grieved deeply over the unhappy situation of his beloved fatherland. The
			Spanish misdeeds awakened in his boyish heart a great determination to fight tyranny. When he became a
			man, many years later, he wrote to his friend, Professor Blumentritt: "In view of these injustices and
			cruelties, although yet a child, my imagination was a awakened and I made a vow dedicating myself
			someday to avenge the many victims. With this idea in my mind, I studied, and this is seen in all my
			writings. Someday God will give me the opportunity to fulfill my promise."
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			<b>Influences on Hero's Boyhood</b>. On the night Jose Rizal was born, other children were born in
			Calamba and hundreds of the children were also born all over the Philippines. But why is it that out of
			these children, only one boy – JOSE RIZAL- rose to fame and greatness? In the lives of all men there are influences which cause some to be great and other not. In the case of Rizal, he had the favorable influences, which no other child in our country had enjoyed. These influences are the following: (1) hereditary influences, (2) environmental influences, and (3) aid of Divine Providence.
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			<b>1. Hereditary Influences:</b> According to biological science, there are inherent traits or
			qualities which a person inherits from his ancestor and parents. From his Malayan ancestors,
			Rizal, evidently, inherited his passionate love for freedom and his serenity of life's outlook. From
			his Chinese ancestor he derived his serious natured, frugality, patience, and love for children.
			From his Spanish ancestors, he got his elegance of bearing, sensitivity to insult, and gallantry to
			ladies. From his father, he inherited a profound sense of self-respect, the love for work, and habit
			of independent thinking. And from his mother, he inherited his religious nature, the spirit of selfsacrifice, and the passion for art and literature.
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			<b>2. Environmental Influence:</b> According to psychologists, environment, as well as heredity,
			affects the nature of a person. Environmental influence includes the places, associates, and
			events. The scenic beauties of Calamba and the beautiful garden of the Rizal family stimulated
			the inborn artistic and literary talents of Jose Rizal. The religious atmosphere at his home fortified
			his religious nature. His brother, Paciano, instilled in his mind the value of brotherly love. From
			his sisters, he learned to be courteous and kind to women. The fairy tales told by his aya during
			his early childhood awakened his interest in folklore and legends. His Uncle Gregorio, taught him
			to love books. His Uncle Jose inspired him to develop his artistic ability. From his Uncle Manuel,
			he learned the importance of good health and sport. And from Father Leoncio Lopez, parish priest
			of Calamba, he acquired the value of intellectual honesty and the love for scholarship. The sorrows in his family, such as the death of Concha in 1865 and the imprisonment of his
			mother in 1872-74, contributed to his melancholy temperament. But such sorrows helped to
			strengthen his character enabling him to resist blows of adversity in later years. The Spanish
			abuses and cruelties which he witnessed of the Guardian Civil and the alcalde, the unjust tortures
			inflicted on innocent Filipinos, and the execution of patriotism and inspired him to dedicate his
			life to redeem his oppressed people.
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			<b>3. Aid of Divine Providence:</b> Greater than heredity and environment in the fate of man is the aid of
			divine Providence. A person may have everything in life – brains, wealth, and power—but,
			without the aid of Divine Providence, he cannot attain greatness in the annals of the nation, Rizal
			was providentially destined to be the pride and glory of our people. God had endowed him with
			the versatile talents of a rare genius, the unsurpassed spirit of nationalism, and the valiant heart to
			sacrifice himself for a noble cause. He gave us this particular genius and hero during the darkest
			period of our history in order that our suffering people might be emancipated from Spanish
			tyranny.
