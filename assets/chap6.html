			With his parents' blessings and unknown to the Spanish authorities, Rizal left Manila on May 3, 1882. He went to Spain where he completed his university studies, improved his knowledge of languages and arts, and further developed his God-give talents for greater service to the fatherland. At that time, the government in Spain was a constitutional monarchy, under which the Spanish people enjoyed individual liberties, including freedom of speech and freedom of press. To Rizal's delight, he saw Spanish politicians and writers openly criticizing the government policies without fear of persecution. He joined the Propaganda Movement, working with other Filipino patriots in seeking reforms to remedy the evils of Spanish rule in the Philippines.
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			<b>Secret Departure for Spain</b>. Rizal's departure for Spain was kept in secret in order to avoid detection by the colonial officials and friars. Even his own parents did no know that he was leaving. Only Uncle Antonio Rivera, Paciano, and his sisters, and some close friends knew.  Paciano gave him 700 pesos. Saturnine later gave him a diamond ring which helped him very much during his days of poverty in Europe. to maintain his studies and sojourn abroad, he needed a monthly allowance of 35 pesos, and this amount Paciano promised to send regularly through Uncle Antonio.
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			Rizal used a passport obtained by a cousin named "Jose Mercado." To outwit the Spanish authorities, he went to Calamba ostensibly to attend the town fiesta. A cryptic telegram by Manuel T. Hidalgo arrived, announcing that the Spanish steamer Salvadora was scheduled to sail for Singapore. Early in the morning of May 1, 1882, he left Calamba by carromata, reaching Manila after 10 hours of travel. He had time to book passage on the Salvadora, to write farewell letters to his family and friends, and bid good-bye to his friends. The kind Jesuit Fathers, whom he visited to say adios, gave him letters of recommendation to the members of their Society in Barcelona. He had also a tearful farewell meeting with his beloved, Leonor. This proved to be their last meeting, for they were destined never to meet again.
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			On his last night in Manila, Rizal with his younger sister Soledad, rode about the city and its suburbs for five hours, changing horses twice. During this nocturnal drive, he told his sister to look after their parents and to extend his farewell greeting to Paciano and sisters.
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			At sunrise of May 3, 1882 – embarkation date – he heard Mass at Santo Domingo Church. He was the still a good Catholic. "I owe much to this religion," he wrote down in his diary, referring to the Catholic Faith, "almost everything that I am." After a hurried breakfast, he boarded the Salvadora which was moored outside the mouth of Pasig River. Some close friends, including Chengoy (Jose M. Cecilio), were on hand to see him off. As the streamer weighed anchor, he saw them waved their handkerchiefs.
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			With tears in his eyes and sadness in his heart, Rizal gazed at the city and his friends. As the streamer sailed awat, he took paper and pencil and sketched his parting view of Manila. 
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			<b>Singapore</b>. During the voyage, Rizal keenly observed the persons and things around him and compared them with those in the Philippines. He was the only Filipino on board. His fellow passengers were foreign travelers and some Spanish employees and merchants returning to Spain. "Almost all of those men," he wrote, speaking of the Spanish passengers, "spoke ill of the country to which they had gone for pecuniary reasons."
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			After five days of sailing, the Salvadora reached the English colony of Singapore. For the first time, Rizal saw Singapore and was impressed by its progress and beautiful sights. He particularly admired "the confidence which the natives of Singapore seemed to have in their government," surely a great contrast to "the fear of their rulers shown by the Filipinos." 
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			Rizal stayed at Hotel de Paz during the two days of his stop-over in Singapore. He spent most of his time visiting the historic places, botanical gardens, temples, and art galleries and writing his diary and letters. 
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			<b>First Trip through the Suez Canal</b>. In Singapore, Rizal boarded the Djemnah, a French steamer, which was sailing to Europe. it was larger and cleaner than the Salvadora. He tried to speak French, but to his surprise the bookish French which he learned in the Ateneo could not be understood. He had to speak it with a mixture of Latin and Spanish words, aided with much gesticulation and frequent sketching on paper, to make himself understood. By persistently speaking French daily, he was able to improve his French. 
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			A week after leaving Singapore, the steamer reached Point de Galle. Rizal with other passengers, went ashore for sightseeing. He found the port to be "sad and sleepy." In the morning of May 18, voyage was resumed, and in the afternoon of the same day the steamer docked at Colombo, Ceylon. During the brief stop-over, Rizal visited the interesting places in town. From Colombo, the streamer crossed the Indian Ocean to Café Guardafui in Africa. The trip was difficult due to stormy weather. Rizal was seasick. On May 28, he saw for the first time the coast of Africa, which he called "inhospitable but famous land." In Aden, Rizal suffered terribly from heat. He observed that it was hotter than his beloved Philippines. On June 2, he arrived at the city of Suez, the Red Sea terminal of the Suez Canal. The beautiful moonlight of thispicturesque city reminded him of his family and Calamba.
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			It took the  Djemnah five days to traverse the Suez Canal. Rizal enjoyed the passage through this canal. He was thrilled because it was his first sight of the historic waterway, which was constructed by the famous Frenchman named Ferdinand de Lesseps and inaugurated on November 17, 1869. At Port Said, the Mediterranean terminal of the canal, Rizal landed to see the interesting spots. He heard the multi-racial residents speaking a babel of tongues – Arabic, Egyptian, Greek, French, Italian, Spanish, etc. He saw the numerous cafes; the churches, mosques and temples; and the colorful customs of both East and West.
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			<b>Naples and Marseilles</b>. From Port Said, the Djemnah proceeded on its way to Europe. On June 11, Rizal reached Naples. This Italian city pleased him because of its business activity, its lively people, and its panoramic beauty. On the night of June 12, the steamer docked at the French harbor of Marseilles. Rizal, after bidding farewell to his fellow passengers, disembarked. He visited the famous place of the city particularly, Chateau d'If, where Dantes, hero of The Count of Monte Cristo, was imprisoned. He had enjoyed reading this novel of Alexander Dumas when he was a student of the Ateneo. He stayed three days in Marseilles, enjoying every day of his sojourn.
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			Barcelona. At Marseilles, Rizal took the train for the last lap of his train to Spain. He crossed the Pyrenees and stopped for a day at the frontier town of Port-Buo. Here, he noticed the indifference accorded by the Spanish immigration officers to tourist, in direct contrast with the courtesy of the French immigration officers After the passport inspect at Port0Buo, Rizal continued his trip by rail, finally reaching his destination – Barcelona. It was the beginning of the summer of 1882.
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			Rizal's first impression of Barcelona, greatest city of Cataluna and Spain's second largest city, was unfavorable. He thought it was ugly, with dirty little inns, and inhospitable residents, because he happened to stay upon his arrival at a dingy inn situated on an unimpressive narrow street in the "town's most ugly side" and the staff and guests in said inn were indifferent to him. Later he changed his bad impression and came to like the city. He found it to be really a great city, with an atmosphere of freedom and liberalism, and its people were open-hearted, hospitable, and courageous. He enjoyed promenading along Las Ramblas, famous street in Barcelona.
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			The Filipinos in Barcelona, some of whom were his schoolmates in the Ateneo, welcomed Rizal. They gave him a party at their favorite café in Plaza de Cataluna. After the customary exchange of toasts, they told their guest of the attractions of Barcelona and the customs of the Spanish people; in turn he gave them the latest news and gossips in the Philippines.
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			"<b>Amor Patrio</b>." In progressive Barcelona, Rizal wrote a nationalistic essay entitled Amor Patrio (Love of Country), his first article written on Spain's soil. He sent this article to his friend in Manila, Basilio Teodoro, who was a member of the editorial staff of the Diariong Tagalog, the first Manila daily to have a Tagalog section. Rizal's Amor Patrio, under his pen name Laong Laan, appeared in print in Diariong Tagalog on August 20, 1882. It was published in two texts – Spanish and Tagalog. The Spanish text was the one originally written by Rizal in Barcelona. The Tagalog text was a Tagalog translation made by M. H. Del Pilar. The article caused quite a sensation among the readers because of its Filipinistic favor. As in his prize-winning Juventud Filipina, Rizal in his Amor Patrio urged his compatriots to love their fatherland, the Philippines. Among the other things he wrote:
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			After the fashion of the ancient Hebrews who offered in the temple the first fruits of their love, we in a foreign land, dedicate our first accents to our country, enshrouded among the clouds and mists of morn, always beautiful and poetic, but ever more idolized in proportion as we are absent and away from it . . . Under whatever aspect, whatever its name we love her (patria) always just as the child loves its mother in the midst of hunger and misery. And how strange! The poorer and more miserable she is, the more we suffer for her, and the more she is idolized and adored; yes, there is real joy in suffering for her . . .
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			Child, we love play; adolescent, we forget it; youth, we seek our ideal; disillusioned, we weep and go in quest of something more positive and more useful; parent, the children die and time gradually erases our pain just as the air of the sea slowly effaces the shores as the boat departs from them. But, love of country can never be effaced, once it has entered the heart, because it carries in itself the divine stamp that makes it eternal and imperishable. It has always been said that love is the most potent force behind the most sublime deeds; very well, of all loves, the love of country is what produced the greatest, the most heroic, the most disinterested. Read history, The editor of Diariong Tagalog, Francisco Calvo, congratulated Rizal for the article and requested him for some more articles. In response to his request, Rizal wrote the second article for Diariong Tagalog entitled Los Viajes (Travels). His third article, entitled Revista de Madrid (Review of Madrid), which he wrote in Madrid on November 29, 1882, was returned to him because the Diariong Tagalog had ceased publication.

			<b>Rizal Moves to Madrid</b>. While sojourning in Barcelona, Rizal received sad news about the cholera that was ravaging Manila and the provinces. Many people had died and more people were dying daily. According to Paciano's letter, dated September 15, 1882, the Calamba folks were having afternoon novenas to San Roque and nocturnal processions and prayers so that God may stop the dreadful epidemic, which the Spanish health authorities were impotent to check. Another sad news form the Philippines was the chatty letter of Chengoy recounting the unhappiness of Leonor Rivera, who was getting thinner because of the absence of a loved one.In one of his letters (dated May 26, 1882), Paciano advised his younger brother to finish the medical course in Madrid. Evidently, heeding his advice, Rizal left Barcelona left Barcelona in the fall of 1882 and established himself in Madrid, the capital of Spain.
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			<b>Life in Madrid</b>. On November 3, 1882, Rizal enrolled in Universidad Central de Madrid (Central University of Madrid) in two courses – Medicine and Philosophy and Letters. Aside from his heavy studies in the university, he studied painting and sculpture in the Academy of San Carlos, took lessons in French, German and English under a private instructor and assiduously practiced fencing and shooting in the Halls of Arms of Sanz y Carbonell. His thirst for knowledge was unlimited. He attended operas and concerts to improve his knowledge of music, he visited the art galleries and museums and read books on all subjects including military engineering, in order to broaden his cultural background.
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			Rizal led a Spartan life in Madrid. He knew that he came to Spain to study and to prepare himself for service to his fatherland. Accordingly, he strictly budgeted his money and time. He lived frugally like an Ilokano, spending his money on food, clothing and books – never a peseta for wine or women. His only extravagance was the Spanish lottery. At every draw, he invested three pesetas on a lottery ticket. He also never wasted time. His spare hours were devoted to attending lectures, operas and religious fiestas; reading at home or at the libraries; conversing with friends at the Paterno living quarters on Calle Sauco and at Café de Pelayo, favorite rendezvous of the Filipino students; sipping coffee at a little café near La Puerta del Sol, where he could watch the cavalcade of life in the Spanish metropolis; and visiting the house of Don Pablo Ortega y Rey, a liberal-minded Spaniard and Civil Governor of Manila during General Carlos Ma. de la Torre's administration.
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			Romance with Consuelo Ortega y Rey. Rizal used to visit the home of Don Pablo Ortega y Rey every Saturday evening. He and other Filipino students played parlor games with his two daughters, Pilar and Consuelo. It was Consuelo who awakened the sparks of love in Rizal's heart.Consuelo loved Rizal. She wrote in her diary that she knew Rizal loved her, though he did not say it. Rizal gave her flowers which she affectionately cherished.
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			Rizal really almost lost his heart to the pretty Madrilena. True that he was engaged to Leonor Rivera, but she was far away, and he was lonely in Madrid. On August 22, 1883, he wrote a lovely poem entitled A la Senorita C.O. y R. With great will power, Rizal did not allow the romance to go on for two reasons; (1) he was still engaged to Leonor Rivera and he would not want to be unfaithful to her and (2) Eduardo de Lete, his friend, was deeply in love with Consuelo, and he did not want to break their friendship just for a wisp of a girl. Thus, in the summer of 1883, he made a quick trip to Paris in order to forget Consuelo.
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			"They Asked Me for Verses." In 1882, shortly after his arrival in Madrid, Rizal joined the Circulo Hispano –Filipino (Hispano-Philippine Circle), a society of Spaniards and Filipinos. Upon the request of the members of the society, he wrote a poem entitled Me Piden Versos (They Asked Me for Verses). In this sad poem, he poured out the cry of his agonizing heart, as follows:
		</div>
		<br>
		<div class="poem">
			<p>YOU ASKED FOR VERSES</p>
			<p>
				You bid me now to strike the lyre,
				That mute and torn so long has lain:
				And yet I cannot wake the strain,
				Nor will the Muse one note inspire!
				Coldly, it shakes in accents dire,
				As if my soul itself to wring,
				And when it sound seems but to fling
				A jest at its own low lament;
				So in sad isolation pent,
			</p>
			<p>
				My soul can neither feel nor sing.
				There was a time – ah, ‘tis too true –
				But that time long ago has past –
				When upon me the Muse had cast
				Indulgent smile and friendship's due;
				But of that age now all too few
				The thoughts that with me yet will stay;
				As from the hours of festive play
				There linger on mysterious notes,
				And in our minds the memory floats
				Of minstrelsy and music gay.
			</p>
			<p>
				A plant that I am, that scarcely grown,
				Was torn from out its Eastern bed,
				Where all around perfume is shed,
				And life but as a dream is known;
				The land that I can call my own,
				By me forgotten ne'er to be,
				Where trilling birds their song taught me,
				And cascades with their ceaseless roar,
				And all along the spreading shore
				The murmurs of the sounding sea.
			</p>
			<p>
				While yet in childhood's happy day,
				I learn upon its sun to smile,
				And in my breast there seems the while
				Seething volcanic fires to play,
				A bard I was, my wish always
				To call upon the fleeting wind,
				"Go forth, and spread around its flame.
				From zone to zone with glad acclaim,
				But it I left, and now no more –
				Like a tree that is broken and sere –
				My natal gods bring the echo clear
				Of songs that in past times they bore;
			</p>
			<p>
				Wide seas I cross'd to foreign shore,
				With hope of change and other fate,
				My folly was made clear too late,
				For in the place of good I sought
				The seas reveal'd unto naught,
				But made death's spectre on me wait.
			</p>
			<p>
				All these fond fancies that were mine,
				All love, all feeling, all emprise,
				Were left beneath the sunny skies;
				Which o'er that flowery region shine;
				So press no more than plea of thine,
				For songs of love from out a heart
				That coldly lies a thing apart;
				Since now with tortur'd soul I haste
				Unresting o'er the desert waste,
				And lifeless gone is all the art.
			</p>
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			Rizal as Lover of Books. A favorite pastime of Rizal in Madrid was reading. Instead of gambling and flirting with women, as many young Filipinos did in the Spanish metropolis, he stayed at home and read voraciously until midnight. Since early childhood, he liked to read. Rizal economized on his living expenses, and with the money he saved, he purchased books from a second-hand bookstore owned by a certain Senor Roses. He was able to build up a fair-sized private library. His collection of books included The Bible, Hebrew Grammar, Lives of the Presidents of the United States from Washington to Johnson, Complete Works of Voltaire (9 volumes), Complete Works of Horace (3 volumes), Complete Works of C. Bernard (16 volumes), History of the French Revolution, The Wandering Jew by Eugene Sue, Ancient Poetry, Works of Thucydides, The Byzantine Empire, The Characters of La Bruyere, The Renaissance, Uncle Tom's Cabin by Harriet Beecher Stowe, Works of Alexander Dumas, Louis XIV and His Court, and numerous book on medicine philosophy, languages, history, geography, arts, and sciences. Rizal was deeply affected by Beecher Stowe's Uncle Tom's Cabin and Eugene Sue's The Wandering Jew. These two books aroused his sympathy for the oppressed and unfortunate people.

			Rizal Becomes a Mason. In Spain, Rizal came in contact with the liberal and republican elements, most of whom were Masons. Being young and lonely in a foreign country, he was easily impressed by the way the prominent Spanish Masons loudly and freely attacked the government and the Church. He knew that in the Philippines, these Spanish Masons would either be executed or jailed if they would so openly assail the government policies or dare criticize the friars	In due time, his friends who were Masons persuaded him to join Masonry. In 1883, he joined the Masonic Lodge Acacia I Madrid. His Masonic name was Dimasalang. Two reasons may be presented why he became a Mason : (1) the bad friars in the Philippines, by their abuses unworthy of their priestly habit or calling, drove Rizal to desperation and to Masonry, and (2) he needed the help of the Masons to fight with the bad friars in the Philippines, for Masonry, to Rizal, was a shield to use in his fight against the evil forces of tyranny Rizal became a Master Mason in Lodge Solidaridad on November 15, 1890. Later, on February 15, 1892, he became a Master Mason of Le Grand Orient France in Paris. Since joining Masonry, Rizal naturally ceased going to the church and he wandered far from the fold of the Faith of his fathers. However, since the Catholic religion was planted deeply in his soul, he continued to have faith in Divine Providence.
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			Financial Worries. During Rizal's absence, things turned from bad to worse in Calamba. The rice and sugar can harvests failed. The price of sugar went down. The rent on the lands cultivated by the Rizal family was raised to exorbitant rate by the manager of the Dominican Estate. This manager, according to Rizal's story, continually raised the land rent of the Rizals because he was sore when Rizal's father refused to give him a fat turkey. This Spanish manager of the hacienda used to ask turkeys from Rizal's father who was a good breeder of turkeys. It so happened that a pest killed many turkeys in the Rizal poultry. A few remained and Rizal's father needed them for breeding purpose. Hence, that year he had to deny the manager's request for a turkey.	During the hard times in Calamba, the regular monthly allowance of Rizal in Madrid decreased, and at time no allowance arrived. At one time, Paciano had to sell his younger brother's pony to send money to Madrid. Several times, he earned a little money by working as a private tutor to rich students.A touching incident in Rizal's life occurred on June 25, 1884. In the morning of that date, he won a prize in Greek on an empty stomach because he had not eaten since the night before due to lack of funds. And in the evening of the same date, he delivered a splendid speech at a banquet honoring two Filipino titans of the brush – Juan Luna and Felix R. Hidalgo.
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			<b>Rizal's Salute to Luna and Hidalgo</b>. At the National Exposition of Fine Arts in Madrid in 1884, both Luna and Hidalgo won signal honors for their country. They entered this art competition against many painters of Europe, and emerged triumphant. Luna's canvas "Spoliarium" won first prize (gold medal), while Hidalgo's "Christian Virgins Exposed to the Populace" was awarded second prize (silver medal).The Filipino colony of Madrid, exulting in the double victory, tendered a banquet at Restaurant Ingles in honor of Luna and Hidalgo. Rizal was invited to give the principal speech, which invitation he readily accepted.	The historic banquet was attended by Filipino and Spanish notables. At the center of the presidential table was seated Luna (honoree): to his right were Messrs, Labra, Correa, Nin, and Tudo; to his left, Messrs, Moret, Agullera, and Mellado; and seated in the other tables were Manuel de Azcarraga, the Paternos (Pedro, Maximino, and Antonio), Morayta and prominent Spanish artists, and men-of-letters.
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			Rizal, at the beginning of his speech, was nervous, for he had never given an address in public before. Gradually, he gained confidence as he talked freely from memory, soaring on the wings of his potential eloquence, and held the hearers spell-bound. He saluted Luna and Hidalgo as the two glories of Spain and the Philippines, whose splendor united with both peoples. Somewhere in his speech, he assailed with refined sarcasm the bigotry and blindness of certain unworthy Spaniards who could not comprehend the universality of genius. Rising on an inspired sonority, he concluded his memorable speech by offering a toast to Luna and Hidalgo, to the youth of the Philippines, to Mother Spain, and to the Filipino parents, whose sons were in Europe.
		</div>
		<br>
		<div>
			Studies Completed in Spain. Rizal completed his medical course in Spain. He was awarded the degree of Licentiate in Medicine by the Universidad Central de Madrid on June 21, 1884. The next academic year (1884-85), he studied and passed all subjects leading to the degree of Doctor of Medicine. "Due to the fact, however, that he did not present the thesis required for graduation nor paid the corresponding fees, he was not awarded his Doctor's diploma." His scholastic records in medicine at the Universidad Central de Madrid are as follows:

			At long last, Rizal completed his studies in both Medicine and Philosophy and Letters. He was ready then to face the world and lead the fight for his country's redemption. He was determined to see more of Europe before returning home, and acquire more medical lore in the clinics of Europe's eminent physicians.
